- In order to get Crate up and running take a look at the `installation.txt`
  and `configuration.txt` file.

- If you are new to Crate, it is probably the best to take a look at
  `hello.txt`.

- For details about working with Crate, see `sql/index.txt`.

The documentation is optimized for HTML output. Linking to other documents
