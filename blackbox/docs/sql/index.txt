CrateDB uses `SQL`_ to query documents.

This section of the documentation provides a full SQL syntax reference.

.. NOTE::

   If you’re just getting started with a particular part of CrateDB, we
   recommend you consult the appropriate top-level section of the
   documentation. The SQL syntax reference assumes a basic familiarity with the
   relevant parts of CrateDB.
