Cluster Wide Privileges
=======================

.. note::

    Privileges are only part of the CrateDB `Enterprise Edition`_.
    When the CrateDB Enterprise Edition is disabled, there will be
    no user privilege checks, and every statement will be executed
    without the validation of privileges.

User privileges are applied on the whole cluster and propagated
to all tables and schemas in the cluster. For example, a user with
``DQL`` privilege can issue ``SELECT`` queries on any table and
schema in the cluster. Similarly a user with ``DML`` privilege can
issue ``INSERT`` statement to any table and schema in the cluster.
There is no option to ``GRANT`` or ``REVOKE`` privileges on object
level, such as table or schema.

.. note::

    Superusers are allowed to execute any statement without any privilege
    checks. Currently only ``DQL``, ``DML`` and ``DDL`` privileges can be
    granted. Any statements which are not allowed with those privileges,
    such as ``GRANT`` and ``REVOKE``, can only be issued by a superuser.

Privilege Types
===============

``DQL``
.......

Granting ``Data Query Language (DQL)`` privilege to a user, indicates that this
user is allowed to execute ``SELECT``, ``SHOW``, ``REFRESH``, ``COPY TO``,
``SET SESSION`` statements, as well as using the available user defined
functions.

``DML``
.......

Granting ``Data Manipulation Language (DML)`` privilege to a user, indicates
that this user is allowed to execute ``INSERT``, ``COPY FROM```, ``UPDATE``
and ``DELETE`` statements.

``DDL``
.......

Granting ``Data Definition Language (DDL)`` privilege to a user, indicates that
this user is allowed to execute ``CREATE TABLE``, ``DROP TABLE``,
``CREATE FUNCTION``, ``DROP FUNCTION``, ``CREATE REPOSITORY``,
``DROP REPOSITORY``, ``CREATE SNAPSHOT``, ``DROP SNAPSHOT``,
``RESTORE SNAPSHOT``, and ``ALTER`` statements.

``GRANT``
=========

.. hide:

    cr> CREATE user wolfgang;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

    cr> CREATE user will;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

To grant a privilege to an existing user we use the :doc:`/sql/reference/grant`
SQL statement, for example::

    cr> GRANT DML TO wolfgang;
    GRANT OK, 1 row affected (... sec)


If a user with the username specified in the SQL statement does not exist the
statement returns an error::

    cr> GRANT DQL TO layla;
    SQLActionException[UserUnknownException: User 'layla' does not exist]

To grant ``ALL PRIVILEGES`` to user will, we can use the following syntax::

    cr> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO will;
    GRANT OK, 3 rows affected (... sec)

Using "ALL PRIVILEGES" is a shortcut to grant all the currently grantable
privileges to a user, namely ``DQL``, ``DML`` and ``DDL``.

Privileges can be granted to multiple users in the same statement, like so::

    cr> GRANT DDL TO wolfgang, will;
    GRANT OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

``REVOKE``
==========

To revoke a privilege that was previously granted to a user use the
:doc:`/sql/reference/revoke` SQL statement, for example::

    cr> REVOKE DDL from will;
    REVOKE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

If a user with the username specified in the SQL statement does not exist the
statement returns an error::

    cr> REVOKE DDL FROM layla;
    SQLActionException[UserUnknownException: User 'layla' does not exist]

``REVOKE ALL`` or ``REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES`` will revoke all privileges
that were previously granted to a user, it can be used like this::

    cr> REVOKE ALL FROM wolfgang;
    REVOKE OK, 2 rows affected (... sec)

Privileges can be revoked from multiple users in the same statement,
like so::

    cr> REVOKE DDL FROM wolfgang, will;
    REVOKE OK, 0 rows affected (... sec)

List Privileges
===============

CrateDB exposes privileges ``sys.privileges`` system table.

.. note::
    Please note that this table can only be accessed by the superuser.

By querying the ``sys.privileges`` table you can get all
information regarding the existing privileges. E.g.::

    cr> SELECT * FROM sys.privileges order by type;
    +---------+---------+---------+-------+-------+------+
    | class   | grantee | grantor | ident | state | type |
    +---------+---------+---------+-------+-------+------+
    | CLUSTER | will    | crate   |  NULL | GRANT | DML  |
    | CLUSTER | will    | crate   |  NULL | GRANT | DQL  |
    +---------+---------+---------+-------+-------+------+
    SELECT 2 rows in set (... sec)

The column ``grantor`` shows the user who granted the privilege, the column ``grantee``
shows the user for whom the privilege was granted. The column ``class`` identifies on
which type of context the privilege applies. ``ident`` stands for the ident of the object
that the privilege is set on and finally ``type`` stands for the type of privileges that
was granted or revoked.
