User Management
===============

.. note::

    User Management is only part of the CrateDB `Enterprise Edition`_.

A CrateDB cluster contains a set of database users. A database user is a
principle at cluster level.

Users can be created using the `CREATE USER`_ statement and removed using the
analoguous `DROP USER`_ statement. These statements are database management
statements that can only be invoked by superusers that already exist in the
CrateDB cluster. Also the users table `sys.users` is only readable by
superusers.

Users cannot be backed up or restored.

    This document is not included in the doctest suite and therefore the
    following statements are not executed.
    The reason for that is, that the HTTP protocol does not support user
    authentication yet.

CREATE USER
-----------

To create a new user for the CrateDB database cluster use the
:doc:`/sql/reference/create_user` SQL statement::

    cr> CREATE USER user_a;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

The newly created user does not have any special privileges.
It can be used to connect to the database cluster using available
authentication methods.

The username parameter of the statement follows the principles of an identifier
which means that it must be double-quoted if it contains special characters
(e.g. whitespace) or if the case needs to be maintained::

    cr> CREATE USER "Custom User";
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

If a user with the username specified in the SQL statement already exists the
statement returns an error::

    cr> CREATE USER "Custom User";
    UserAlreadyExistsException ...

DROP USER
---------

.. hide:

    cr> CREATE USER user_b;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

To remove an existing user from the CrateDB database cluster use the
:doc:`/sql/reference/drop_user` SQL statement::

    cr> DROP USER user_b;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

If a user with the username specified in the SQL statement does not exist the
statement returns an error::

    cr> DROP USER user_b;
    UserDoesNotExistException ...

It is not possible to drop the built-in superuser ``crate``.

List Users
----------

CrateDB exposes database users via the read-only ``sys.users`` system table.
The ``sys.users`` table shows all users in the cluster which can be used for
authentication. The initial superuser ``crate`` which is available for all
CrateDB clusters is also part of that list.

To list all existing users query that table::

    cr> SELECT * FROM sys.users;
    +-------------+-----------+
    | name        | superuser |
    +-------------+-----------+
    | crate       | TRUE      |
    | Custom User | FALSE     |
    | user_a      | FALSE     |
    +-------------+-----------+
    SELECT 3 rows in set (... sec)

The column ``name`` shows the unique name of the user, the column ``superuser``
shows whether the user has superuser privileges or not.
