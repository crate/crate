Backup with Snapshot and Restore
================================

Snapshot
--------

In CRATE, backups are called *Snapshots*. They represent the state of
the tables in a CRATE cluster at the time the *Snapshot* was
created. A *Snapshot* is always stored in a *Repository* which has to
be created first.

Creating a Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Repositories are used to store, manage and restore snapshots.

They are created using the :ref:`ref-create-repository` statement::

    cr> CREATE REPOSITORY where_my_snapshots_go TYPE fs
    ... WITH (location='repo_path', compress=true);
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

Repositories are uniquely identified by their name. Every repository
has a specific type which determines how snapshots are stored.

CRATE supports different repository types:
:ref:`ref-create-repository-types-fs`, :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-hdfs`,
:ref:`ref-create-repository-types-s3`, and
:ref:`ref-create-repository-types-url`. Support for further types can be
added using :ref:`plugins`.

The creation of a repository configures it inside the crate cluster. In
general no data is written, no snapshots inside repositories changed or
deleted. This way you can tell the CRATE cluster about existing repositories
which already contain snapshots.

Creating a repository with the same name will result in an error::

    cr> CREATE REPOSITORY where_my_snapshots_go TYPE fs
    ... WITH (location='another_repo_path', compress=false);
    SQLActionException[RepositoryAlreadyExistsException: Repository 'where_my_snapshots_go' already exists]

Creating a Snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapshots are created inside a repository and can contain any number
of tables. The :ref:`ref-create-snapshot` statement is used to create
a snapshots::

    cr> CREATE SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot1 ALL
    ... WITH (wait_for_completion=true, ignore_unavailable=true);
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

A snapshot is referenced by the name of the repository and the snapshot name,
separated by a dot. If ``ALL`` is used, all *user created* tables of the
cluster (except blob tables) are stored inside the snapshot.

It's possible to only save a specific subset of tables in the snapshot by
listing them explicitly::

    cr> CREATE SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot2 TABLE quotes, doc.locations
    ... WITH (wait_for_completion=true);
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

.. Hidden: create partitioned table

    cr> CREATE TABLE parted_table (
    ...   id int,
    ...   value string,
    ...   date timestamp
    ... ) clustered into 1 shards partitioned by (date) with (number_of_replicas=0);
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)
    cr> INSERT INTO parted_table (id, value, date)
    ... VALUES (1, 'foo', '1970-01-01'), (2, 'bar', '2015-10-19');
    INSERT OK, 2 rows affected (... sec)
    cr> REFRESH TABLE parted_table;
    REFRESH OK, 2 rows affected (... sec)

Even single partition of :ref:`partitioned_tables` can be selected
for backup. This is especially useful if old partitions need to be
deleted but it should be possible to restore them if needed::

    cr> CREATE SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot3 TABLE
    ...    locations,
    ...    parted_table PARTITION (date='1970-01-01')
    ... WITH (wait_for_completion=true);
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

Snapshots are **incremental**. Snapshots of the same cluster created later
only store data not already contained in the repository.

All examples above are used with the argument ``wait_for_completion``
set to *true*. As described in the :ref:`ref-create-repository`
reference documentation, by doing this, the statement will only respond
(successfully or not) when the snapshot is fully created.
Otherwise the snapshot will be created in the background and
the statement will immediately respond as successful. The status of a
created snapshot can be retrieved by querying the :ref:`sys.snapshots
<sys-snapshots>` system table.

Restore
-------

Once a snapshot is created, it can be used to restore its tables to
the state when the snapshot was created.

To get basic information about snapshots the :ref:`sys.snapshots
<sys-snapshots>` table can be queried::

    cr> SELECT repository, name, state, concrete_indices
    ... FROM sys.snapshots
    ... ORDER BY repository, name;
    +-----------------------+-----------+---------+--------------------...-+
    | repository            | name      | state   | concrete_indices       |
    +-----------------------+-----------+---------+--------------------...-+
    | where_my_snapshots_go | snapshot1 | SUCCESS | [...]                  |
    | where_my_snapshots_go | snapshot2 | SUCCESS | [...]                  |
    | where_my_snapshots_go | snapshot3 | SUCCESS | [...]                  |
    +-----------------------+-----------+---------+--------------------...-+
    SELECT 3 rows in set (... sec)

To restore a table from a snapshot we have to drop it beforehand::

    cr> DROP TABLE quotes;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

Restoring a snapshot using the :ref:`ref-restore-snapshot` statement.::

    cr> RESTORE SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot2 TABLE quotes WITH (wait_for_completion=true);
    RESTORE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

In this case only the ``quotes`` table from snapshot
``where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot2`` is restored. Using ``ALL`` instead
of listing all tables restores the whole snapshot.

It's not possible to restore tables that exist in the current cluster::

    cr> RESTORE SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot2 TABLE quotes;
    SQLActionException[TableAlreadyExistsException: The table 'doc.quotes' already exists.]

Single partitions can be either imported into an existing partitioned
table the partition belongs to.

.. Hidden: drop partition::

    cr> DELETE FROM parted_table WHERE date = '1970-01-01';
    DELETE OK, -1 rows affected (... sec)

::

    cr> RESTORE SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot3 TABLE
    ...    parted_table PARTITION (date='1970-01-01')
    ... WITH (wait_for_completion=true);
    RESTORE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)


Or if no matching partition table exists, it will be implicitly
created during restore.

.. note::

    This is only possible with Crate version 0.55.5 or greater!
    Snapshots of single partitions that have been created with earlier versions
    of Crate may be restored, but lead to orphaned partitions!
    When using Crate prior to 0.55.5 you will have to create the table schema
    first before restoring.

::

    cr> DROP TABLE parted_table;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

    cr> RESTORE SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot3 TABLE
    ...    parted_table PARTITION (date=0)
    ... WITH (wait_for_completion=true);
    RESTORE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)


Cleanup
-------

Dropping Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dropping a snapshot deletes all files inside the repository that are
only referenced by this snapshot. Due to its incremental nature this
might be very few files (e.g. for intermediate snapshots). Snapshots
are dropped using the :ref:`ref-drop-snapshot` command::

    cr> DROP SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot3;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)


Dropping Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Hidden: create repository

    cr> CREATE REPOSITORY "OldRepository" TYPE fs WITH (location='old_path');
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

If a repository is not needed anymore, it can be dropped using the
:ref:`ref-drop-repository` statement::

    cr> DROP REPOSITORY "OldRepository";
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

This statement, like :ref:`ref-create-repository`, does not manipulate
repository contents but only deletes stored configuration for this
repository in the cluster state, so it's not accessible any more.


.. Hidden: cleanup

    cr> DROP TABLE parted_table;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)
    cr> DROP SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot1;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)
    cr> DROP SNAPSHOT where_my_snapshots_go.snapshot2;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)
    cr> DROP REPOSITORY where_my_snapshots_go;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

Requirements for using repositories of type 'hdfs'
--------------------------------------------------

Crate supports repositories of type
:ref:`ref-create-repository-types-hdfs` type by default, but required
`Hadoop`_ java client libraries are not included in any Crate
distribution and need to be added to Crate's hdfs plugin hadoop libs
folder.  By default this is
``$CRATE_HOME/plugins/elasticsearch-repository-hdfs/hadoop-libs``

Because some libraries `Hadoop`_ depends on are also required (and so
deployed) by Crate, only the `Hadoop`_ libraries listed below for the
concrete `Hadoop`_ version must be copied, other libraries will be
ignored.

.. note::

   After installing all needed libraries, every node must be restarted.

Hadoop 1.x required libraries

into the ``$CRATE_HOME/plugins/hdfs/libs`` folder::
