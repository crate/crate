Synopsis
========

::

    RESTORE SNAPSHOT repository_name.snapshot_name
    { TABLE ( table_ident [ PARTITION (partition_column = value [ , ... ])] [, ...] ) | ALL }
    [ WITH (restore_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]

Description
===========

Restore one or more tables or partitions from an existing snapshot into the
cluster. The snapshot must be given as fully qualified reference with
``repository_name`` and ``snapshot_name``.

It is possible to restore all tables contained in the snapshot using the
``ALL`` keyword. Single tables and/or partitions can be selected for restoring
by giving them as ``table_ident`` or partition reference given the
``partition_column`` values.

Tables that are to be restored must not exist yet.

To cancel a restore operation simply drop the tables that are being restored.

Parameters
==========

:repository_name: the name of the repository of the snapshot to restore as
                  ident

:snapshot_name: the name of the snapshot as ident

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table that
              is to be restored from the snapshot

:partition_column: Column name by which the table is partitioned

Clauses

``WITH``
--------

::

    [ WITH (restore_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]

The following configuration parameters can be used to modify how the snapshot
is restored to the cluster:

:ignore_unavailable: (Default ``false``) Per default the restore command fails
                     if a table is given that does not exist in the snapshot.
                     If set to ``true`` those missing tables are ignored.

:wait_for_completion: (Default: ``false``) By default the request returns once
                      the restore operation started. If set to ``true`` the
                      request returns after all selected tables from the
                      snapshot are restored or an error occurred. In order to
                      monitor the restore operation the * :ref:`sys.shards
                      <sys-shards>` table can be queried.
