Synopsis
========

::

    REFRESH TABLE (table_ident [ PARTITION (partition_column=value [ , ... ])] [, ...] )

Description
===========

The REFRESH TABLE command refreshes one or more tables and all its rows, making
all changes made to that table available to all further commands.

The ``PARTITION`` clause can be used to only refresh specific partitions of a
partitioned table. All columns by which a table is partitioned are required.

In case the ``PARTITION`` clause is omitted all partitions will be refreshed.
For performance reasons doing that should be avoided if possible.

See :ref:`partitioned_tables` for more information on partitioned tables.

Without issuing this statement there is no guarantee that a change (``UPDATE``,
``DELETE``, ``COPY`` or ``INSERT``) will be seen by an immediately following
``SELECT`` statement for the row(s) affected by this change. By default a
refresh is scheduled periodically.

Internally a refresh opens a new table reader, which is then used by all
subsequent searches on the affected table.

For further details see :ref:`refresh_data`. For changing the refresh interval
see :ref:`sql_ref_refresh_interval`.

Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table that
              is to be refreshed.

:partition_column: Column name by which the table is partitioned.

                   statement must be specified.
