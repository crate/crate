Description
===========

``CREATE USER`` is a management statement to create a new database user in the
CrateDB cluster. The newly created user does not have any special privileges.
The created user can be used to authenticate against CrateDB, see

The statement allows to specify a password for this account. This is not
necessary if password authentication is disabled.

For usage of the ``CREATE USER`` statement see
:ref:`administration_user_management`.

Parameters

           principles of a SQL identifier (see

Clauses
