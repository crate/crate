Synopsis
========

::

    INSERT INTO table_ident
      [ ( column_ident [, ...] ) ]
      { VALUES ( expression [, ...] ) [, ...] | ( query ) | query }
      [ ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
        { column_ident = expression } [, ...]
      ]

Description
===========

INSERT creates one or more rows specified by value expressions.

The target column names can be listed in any order. If no list of column names
is given at all, the default is all the columns of the table in lexical order;
or the first N column names, if there are only N columns supplied by the VALUES
clause. The values supplied by the VALUES clause are associated with the
explicit or implicit column list left-to-right.

Each column not present in the explicit or implicit column list will not be
filled.

If the expression for any column is not of the correct data type, automatic
type conversion will be attempted.

.. _on_duplicate_key_update:

``ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE``
---------------------------

If ``ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`` is specified and a row is inserted that would
cause a duplicate-key conflict, an update of the existing row is performed.

::

      ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE { column_ident = expression } [, ...]

Within expressions in the ``UPDATE`` clause you can use the
``VALUES(column_ident)`` function to refer to column values from the INSERT
statement.

So ``VALUES(column_ident)`` in the ``UPDATE`` clause referes to the value of
the column_ident that would be inserted if no duplicate-key conflict occured.

This function is especially useful in multiple-row inserts, because the values
of the current row can be referenced.

Insert From Dynamic Queries Constraints
---------------------------------------

In some cases ``SELECT`` statements produce invalid data. This opens a rare
occasion for inconsistent outcomes. If the select statement produces data where
a few rows contain invalid column names, or where you have rows which types are
not compatible among themselves, some rows will be inserted while others will
fail. In this case the errors are logged on the node. This could happen in the
following cases:

  * If you select invalid columns or incompatible data types with unnest
    e.g.::

        select unnest([{foo=2}, {foo='a string'}])

    or::

        select unnest([{_invalid_col='foo', valid_col='bar'}])

  * If you select from an ignored object which contains different data
    types for the same object column, e.g.::

        insert into from_table (o) values ({col='foo'}),({col=1})
        insert into to_table (i) (select o['col'] from t)

Any updates which happened before the failure will be persisted, which will
lead to inconsistent outcomes. So special care needs to be taken by the
application when using statements which might produce dynamic data.

Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The identifier (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing
              table.

:column_ident: The name of a column or field in the table pointed to by
               table_ident.

:expression: An expression or value to assign to the corresponding column.
             Within a ``ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`` clause the expression may
             also refer to an expression from VALUES by using ``VALUES (
             column_ident )``

:query: A query (SELECT statement) that supplies the rows to be inserted. Refer
        to the ``SELECT`` statement for a description of the syntax.
