===========
SET / RESET
===========

Alter and restore global cluster setting values at runtime.
For a list of the possible settings see
:ref:`conf-cluster-settings`. Only settings documented with
*Runtime:*  ``yes`` can be changed.


Synopsis
========

::

    SET GLOBAL [ PERSISTENT | TRANSIENT ] setting_ident [ = | TO ] value [ , ... ]

    RESET GLOBAL setting_ident [ , ... ]

Description
===========

Using the ``SET`` and ``RESET`` statements it is possible to configure
the crate cluster at runtime.

``SET`` can be used to change a configuration setting ident to a
different value. Using ``RESET`` will reset the setting to its
default value or, if the setting was defined at the configuration
file on node start-up, to this value.

Parameters
==========

:setting_ident: The full qualified setting ident of the setting to set / reset.

:value: The value to set for the configuration setting.


Persistence
===========

The default is ``TRANSIENT``. Settings that are changed using the ``TRANSIENT``
keyword will be lost if the cluster is stopped or restarted.

Using the ``PERSISTENT`` keyword will persist the changes to disk so that the
change will survive cluster restarts.

.. NOTE::

   The persistence keyword can only be used within a ``SET`` statement.
