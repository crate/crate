Synopsis
========

::

    DELETE FROM table_ident [ [AS] table_alias ] [ WHERE condition ]

Description
===========

DELETE deletes rows that satisfy the WHERE clause from the specified table. If
the WHERE clause is absent, the effect is to delete all rows in the table. The
result is a valid, but empty table.

Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table to
              delete rows from.

:table_alias: A substitute name for the target table. When an alias is
              provided, it completely hides the actual name of the table. For
              example, given ``DELETE FROM foo AS f``, the remainder of the
              'DELETE' statement must refer to this table as 'f' not 'foo'.

:condition: An expression that returns a value of type boolean. Only rows for
            which this expression returns true will be deleted.
