Table Constraints
=================

Table constraints are constraints that are applied to more than one column or
to the table as a whole.

The supported table constraints currently are:

 * :ref:`primary_key_constraint`
 * :ref:`index-constraint`


.. _primary_key_constraint:

``PRIMARY KEY`` Constraint
==========================

The PRIMARY KEY constraint specifies that a column or columns of a
table can contain only unique (non-duplicate), non-null values.

Using columns of type ``object``, ``geo_point``, ``geo_shape`` or ``array`` as
PRIMARY KEY is not supported.


To use a whole ``object`` as PRIMARY KEY each column within the ``object`` can
be declared as PRIMARY KEY instead.

Adding a PRIMARY KEY column is only possible if the table is empty.

.. warning::

    The verification if the table is empty and the schema update isn't atomic.
    That means that it could be possible to add a primary key column to a table
    that isn't empty.
    If that is the case queries that contain the primary key columns in the
    WHERE clause will not behave as expected.

.. _index-constraint:

``INDEX`` Constraint
====================

The INDEX constraint specifies a specific index method on one or more
columns.

It is possible to define more than one index per table, whether as a
column constraint or a table constraint.

For further details about the meaning of the options see
:ref:`indices_and_fulltext`.


.. _column_constraints:

Column Constraints
==================

Column constraints are constraints that are applied on each column of the table separately.
The supported column constraints are:

 * :ref:`not_null_constraint`
 * :ref:`primary_key_constraint`


.. _not_null_constraint:

``NOT NULL`` Constraint
-----------------------

The NOT NULL constraint specifies that a column of a table can contain only non-null values.
The columns that are part of the primary key of a table are NOT NULL by default.
