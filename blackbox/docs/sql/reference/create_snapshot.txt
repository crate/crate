``CREATE SNAPSHOT``
===================

Create a new incremental snapshot inside a repository that contains the current
state of the given tables and/or partitions and the cluster metadata.

Synopsis
========

::

    CREATE SNAPSHOT repository_name.snapshot_name
    { TABLE ( table_ident [ PARTITION (partition_column = value [ , ... ])] [, ...] ) | ALL }
    [ WITH (snapshot_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]

Description
===========

Create a new incremental snapshot inside a repository.

A snapshot is a backup of the current state of the given tables and the cluster
metadata at the point the CREATE SNAPSHOT query starts executing. Changes made
after that are not considered for the snapshot.

A snapshot is fully qualified by its ``snapshot_name`` and the name of the
repository it should be created in (``repository_name``). A ``snapshot_name``
must be unique per repository.

.. NOTE::

   For snapshot names the same :ref:`restrictions
   <sql_ddl_naming_restrictions>` as for table names apply.

   This is mainly because snapshot names will likely become stored as file or
   directory on disc and hence must be valid filenames.

Creating the snapshot operates on primary shards which are not currently
relocated. If a shard is being relocated the snapshot of the shard is created
when the relocation is completed.

A snapshot only backups the parts of the data that are not yet stored in the
given repository by older snapshots, thus creating snapshots is incremental.

Snapshots can include one or more tables, each given as ``table_ident``. It is
also possible to include only single partitions given the values of the
partition columns.

If ``ALL`` is used, every table in the cluster (except system tables, blob
tables and information_schema tables) as well as all persistent settings and
the full cluster metadata is included in the snapshot.

Parameters
==========

:repository_name: the name of the repository to create the snapshot in as ident

:snapshot_name: the name of the snapshot as ident

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing
              table that is to be included in the snapshot

:partition_column: Column name by which the table is partitioned

Clauses
=======

``WITH``
--------

::

    [ WITH (snapshot_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]

The following configuration parameters can be used to modify how the snapshot
is created:

:wait_for_completion: (Default ``false``) By default the request returns once
                      the snapshot creation started. If set to ``true`` the
                      request returns after the whole snapshot was created or
                      an error occurred. The :ref:`sys.snapshots
                      <sys-snapshots>` table can be queried to track the
                      snapshot creation progress if ``wait_for_completion`` has
                      been set to ``false``.

:ignore_unavailable: (Default ``false``) if a given table does not exist the
                     command will fail by default. If set to ``true`` these
                     tables are ignored and not included in the snapshot.
