======================
``CREATE INGEST RULE``
======================

Defines a new ingestion rule.

Synopsis
========
.. highlight:: psql

::

    CREATE INGEST RULE rule_name
    ON source_ident
    [WHERE condition]
    INTO table_ident


Description
===========

``CREATE INGEST RULE`` creates a new ingestion rule, applying on a
``source_ident`` and ingesting into the specified target ``table_ident``.

The ingestion rules will be used by ingestion implementations to filter the
``source_ident`` stream, the filtered data will then be stored in the
corresponding target ``table_ident``.

Parameters
==========

:rule_name: The identifier of the rule to create.

:source_ident: The registration identifier of an ingestion implementation.

:condition: A boolean expression using references specific to the ingestion
            implementation.

:table_ident: The identifier of the target table.


Notes
=====

.. NOTE::

    When the :ref:`administration_user_management` is enabled, this statement
    can only be issued by a superuser.

Ingestion rules can be created and dropped, even if no ingestion implementation
is available. In such case the ingestion rules will not take any effect, until
the ingestion implementation is installed.

There is no default ingestion rule,  all incoming streams into any ingestion
endpoint should be discarded by default by any ingestion implementation.

The target table must be created manually, and should contain the same
structure as the ingestion implementation's data structure. Otherwise, the
ingestion will fail and an error will be logged.

The references to be used in the ``WHERE`` clause are specific to each
ingestion implementation.

Examples
========

Create an ingestion rule on ``mqtt``, that filters the ``mqtt`` messages by
topic and stores the messages in ``my_schema.raw_v4``
::

    CREATE INGEST RULE v4 ON mqtt WHERE topic like 'v4/%' INTO my_schema.raw_v4

This statement will return an error if the table ``my_schema.raw_v4`` does not
exist.


.. SEEALSO::

    :ref:`drop-ingest-rule` for deleting ingestion rules.

    :ref:`information_schema_ingest` to list all existing ingestion rules
