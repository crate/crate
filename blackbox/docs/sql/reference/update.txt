Synopsis
========

::

    UPDATE table_ident [ [AS] table_alias ] SET
        { column_ident = expression } [, ...]
      [ WHERE condition ]

Description
===========

UPDATE changes the values of the specified columns in all rows that satisfy the
condition. Only the columns to be modified need be mentioned in the SET clause;
columns not explicitly modified retain their previous values.

Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The identifier (optionally schema-qualified) of an
              existing table.

:table_alias: A substitute name for the target table. When an alias is
              provided, it completely hides the actual name of the table. For
              example, given ``UPDATE foo AS f``, the remainder of the 'UPDATE'
              statement must refer to this table as 'f' not 'foo'.

:column_ident: The name of a column in the table identified by table_ident.
               Subfields can also be defined by using the subscript notation
               with square brackets.

:expression: An expression to assign to the column.

:condition: An expression that returns a value of type boolean. Only rows for
            which this expression returns true will be updated.
