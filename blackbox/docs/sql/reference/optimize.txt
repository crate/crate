========
OPTIMIZE
========

Optimize one or more tables explicitly.

Synopsis
========

::

    OPTIMIZE TABLE (table_ident [ PARTITION (partition_column=value [ , ... ])] [, ...] )
    [ WITH ( optimization_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]

Description
===========

The OPTIMIZE TABLE command optimizes tables and table partitions by merging
the segments of a table or a partition and reducing their number.
This command will block until the optimization process is complete.
If connection with DB is lost, the request will continue in the background,
and any new requests will block until the previous optimization is complete.

The ``PARTITION`` clause can be used to only optimize specific partitions of a
partitioned table. All columns by which a table is partitioned are required.

In case the ``PARTITION`` clause is omitted all partitions will be optimized.
For performance reasons doing that should be avoided if possible.

See :ref:`sql_ddl_partitioned_by` for more information on partitioned tables.

For further details see :ref:`optimize`.

.. note::

    System tables and blob tables cannot be optimized


Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing
              table that is to be optimized.

:partition_column: Column name by which the table is partitioned.


PARTITION Clause
================

::

    [ PARTITION ( partition_column = value [ , ... ] ) ]


:partition_column: The name of the column by which the table is partitioned.
                   All partition columns that were part of the
                   :ref:`partitioned_by_clause` of the :ref:`ref-create-table`
                   statement must be specified.

:value: The columns value.


WITH Clause
===========

The optional WITH clause can specify parameters for the optimization request.

::

    [ WITH ( optimization_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]

:optimization_parameter: specifies an optional parameter for the optimization request.

Available parameters are:

:max_num_segments: The number of segments to merge to. To fully merge the table or partition set it to 1.
                   Defaults to simply checking if a merge is necessary, and if so, executes it.

:only_expunge_deletes: Should the merge process only expunge segments with deletes in it.
                       In Crate, a row is not deleted from a segment, just marked as deleted.
                       During a merge process of segments, a new segment is created that does
                       not have those deletes. This flag allows to only merge segments that
                       have deletes. Defaults to false.

:flush: Instructs if a flush should be performed after the optimization. Defaults to true.
