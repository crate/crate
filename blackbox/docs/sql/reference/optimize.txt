Synopsis
========

::

    OPTIMIZE TABLE (table_ident [ PARTITION (partition_column=value [ , ... ])] [, ...] )
    [ WITH ( optimization_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]

Description
===========

The OPTIMIZE TABLE command optimizes tables and table partitions by merging the
segments of a table or a partition and reducing their number. It is also used
to upgrade tables and table partitions to the current version of the storage
engine. This command will block until the optimization process is complete. If
the connection to CrateDB is lost, the request will continue in the background,
and any new requests will block until the previous optimization is complete.

The ``PARTITION`` clause can be used to only optimize specific partitions of a
partitioned table. All columns by which a table is partitioned are required.

In case the ``PARTITION`` clause is omitted all partitions will be optimized.
For performance reasons doing that should be avoided if possible.

See :ref:`partitioned_tables` for more information on partitioned tables.

For further information see :ref:`optimize`.

.. NOTE::

    System tables cannot be optimized

Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table that
              is to be optimized.

:partition_column: Column name by which the table is partitioned.

Clauses
=======

``PARTITION``
-------------

::

    [ PARTITION ( partition_column = value [ , ... ] ) ]

:partition_column: The name of the column by which the table is partitioned.
                   All partition columns that were part of the
                   :ref:`partitioned_by_clause` of the :ref:`ref-create-table`
                   statement must be specified.

:value: The columns value.

``WITH``
--------

The optional WITH clause can specify parameters for the optimization request.

::

    [ WITH ( optimization_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]

:optimization_parameter: specifies an optional parameter for the optimization
                         request.

Available parameters are:

:max_num_segments: The number of segments to merge to. To fully merge the table
                   or partition set it to 1.

                   Defaults to simply checking if a merge is necessary, and if
                   so, executes it.

:only_expunge_deletes: Should the merge process only expunge segments with
                       deletes in it. In CrateDB, a row is not deleted from a
                       segment, just marked as deleted. During a merge process
                       of segments, a new segment is created that does not have
                       those deletes. This flag allows to only merge segments
                       that have deletes. Defaults to false.

:flush: Instructs if a flush should be performed after the optimization.
        Defaults to true.

:upgrade_segments: Don't optimize but instead upgrade all segments of the
                   table/partition to the current version of storage engine.
                   Defaults to false.

.. NOTE::

    ``upgrade_segments`` cannot be used in combination with other parameters
