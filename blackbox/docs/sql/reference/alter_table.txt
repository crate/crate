ALTER TABLE
===========

Alter an existing table

Synopsis
========

::

    ALTER [ BLOB ] TABLE { ONLY table_ident
                           | table_ident [ PARTITION (partition_column = value [ , ... ]) ] }
      { SET ( parameter = value [ , ... ] )
        | RESET ( parameter [ , ... ] )
        | ADD [ COLUMN ] column_name data_type [ column_constraint [ ... ] ]
        | OPEN
        | CLOSE
        | RENAME TO table_ident
      }

where ``column_constraint`` is::

    { PRIMARY KEY |
      NOT NULL |
      INDEX { OFF | USING { PLAIN |
                            FULLTEXT [ WITH ( analyzer = analyzer_name ) ]  }
    }

Description
===========

ALTER TABLE can be used to alter an existing table.

``SET`` can be used to change a table parameter to a different value. Using
``RESET`` will reset the parameter to its default value.

``ADD COLUMN`` can be used to add an additional column to a table.

While columns can be added at any time, adding a new
:ref:`generated column <ref-generated-columns>` is only possible if the table is empty.

``OPEN`` and ``CLOSE`` can be used to open or close the table, respectively.
Closing a table prevents all operations, except ``ALTER TABLE ... OPEN``, to
fail. Operations on closed partitions will not produce an exception, but will have
no effect. Similarly, like ``SELECT`` and ``INSERT`` on partitioned will exclude
closed partitions and continue working.

``RENAME TO`` can be used to rename a table, while maintaining its schema and data.
During this operation the table will be closed, and all operations upon the table
will fail until the rename operation is completed.

Use the ``BLOB`` keyword in order to alter a blob table (see
:ref:`blob_support`). Blob tables cannot have custom columns which means that
the ``ADD COLUMN`` keyword won't work.

While altering a partitioned table, using ``ONLY`` will apply changes
for the table **only** and not for any possible existing partitions. So
these changes will only be applied to new partitions. The ``ONLY``
keyword cannot be used together with a `PARTITION Clause`_.


Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to alter.

:parameter: The name of the parameter that is set to a new value or its default.

:column_name: Name of the column which should be added.

:data_type: data type of the column which should be added.

See the CREATE TABLE :ref:`with_clause` for a list of available parameters.

.. _ref-alter-table-partition-clause:

PARTITION Clause
================

If the table is partitioned this clause can be used to alter only a single partition.

.. note:: BLOB tables cannot be partitioned and hence this clause cannot be used.

This clause identifies a single partition. It takes one or more partition
columns with a value each to identify the partition to alter.

::

    [ PARTITION ( partition_column = value [ , ... ] ) ]


:partition_column: The name of the column by which the table is partitioned.
                   All partition columns that were part of the
                   :ref:`partitioned_by_clause` of the :ref:`ref-create-table`
                   statement must be specified.

:value: The columns value.
