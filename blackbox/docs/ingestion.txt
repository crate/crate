Ingestion Framework
===================

Aside from using standard SQL to ingest data, CrateDB offers the possibility to
ingest data through custom event-based ingestion endpoints. The ingestion
framework of CrateDB provides highly available and distributed endpoints for
custom protocols where thousands of events are being sent simultaneously,
such as MQTT_. With CrateDB's ingestion framework no intermediate queues or
brokers need to be set up.


Terms And Concepts
==================

Ingestion is configured via *ingestion rules* which define how
incoming data gets routed and stored. Such ingestion rules are bound
to a specific *ingestion source*. Ingestion sources are provided by
custom implementations, available as builtin components or as
:ref:`CrateDB-Plugins <plugins>`.

:Ingestion Rule:

  An ingestion rule defines where to put the incoming data of a
  specific ingestion source, based on predefined conditions. For more,
  details see :ref:`administration-ingestion-rules`

:Ingestion Source:

  An ingestion source is a registered source of data. Such sources are
  registered and accessed by their unique *source ident*, provided by
  the implementation.

  How data is flowing into the system is completely implementation
  specific. This could be an MQTT_ endpoint, a component listening to
  HTTP-POSTs or a module listening for Kernel events.
