Ingestion Framework
===================

Besides using standard SQL to ingest data, CrateDB also allows for
ingesting data through custom event based ingestion endpoints. The
ingestion framework of CratedB opens up the possibility to provide
highly available distributed endpoints for custom protocols like
MQTT_, where thousands of clients can send their events simultaniously
by using the scalability of CrateDB without requiring to setup any
intermediate queues or brokers.

Terms And Concepts
==================

Ingestion is configured via *ingestion rules* which define how
incomming data gets routed and stored. Such ingestion rules are bound
to a specific *ingestion source*. Ingestion sources are provided by
custom implementations, available as builtin components or as
:ref:`CrateDB-Plugins <plugins>`.

:Ingestion Rule:

  An ingestion rule defines where to put the incomming data of a
  specific ingestion source and also based on which conditions. For a
  details see :ref:`ingestion_rules`


:Ingestion Source:

  An ingestion source is a registered source of data. Such sources are
  registred and accessed by their unique *source ident*, provided by
  the implementation.

  How data is flowing into the system is totally implementation
  specific. This could be an MQTT_ endpoint a compnenent listening to
  HTTP-POSTs or a module listening for Kernel events.
