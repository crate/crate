Ingestion Framework
===================

As well as allowing you to ingest data via standard SQL inserts, CrateDB
provides an ingestion framework that allows you to ingest data through custom
event-based ingestion sources.

The CrateDB ingestion framework provides highly available and distributed
ingestion sources for custom protocols where thousands of events are being sent
simultaneously, such as MQTT_. No intermediate queues or brokers need to
be set up.

The Basics
==========

Ingestion is configured via *ingestion rules*, which define how incoming data
gets routed and stored. For more, details see
:ref:`administration-ingestion-rules`.

Ingestion rules are bound to a specific *ingestion source*.

An ingestion source is a registered source of data. Such sources are registered
and accessed by their unique identification, also known as the ``source_ident``.

How data flows into the data source is implementation specific. For example, a
data source could get data from an MQTT_ endpoint, an HTTP webhook, or a module
listening for Kernel events.

Here's how it all hooks together:
