===================
Ingestion Framework
===================

As well as allowing you to ingest data via standard SQL inserts, CrateDB
provides an ingestion framework that allows you to ingest data through custom
event-based ingestion sources.

The CrateDB ingestion framework provides highly available and distributed
ingestion sources for custom protocols where thousands of events are being sent
simultaneously, such as :ref:`MQTT <ingest_mqtt>`. No intermediate queues or
brokers need to be set up.

Ingestion is configured via *ingestion rules*, which define how incoming data
gets routed and stored. For more, details see
:ref:`ingestion rules docs <administration-ingestion-rules>`.

Ingestion rules are bound to a specific *ingestion source*.

An :ref:`ingestion source <administration-ingestion-sources>` is a registered
source of external data. External data access is always implementation
specific. For example, an ingestion source could get data from an :ref:`MQTT
<ingest_mqtt>` endpoint, an HTTP webhook, or a module listening for kernel
events.

Here's how it all hooks together:
