=========
Crate CLI
=========

After downloading and extracting the tarball (see :ref:`install_targz`)
you will be able to invoke the Crate executable in the ``bin`` directory.
The excutable is named ``crate``.

The simplest way to start a Crate instance is to invoke ``crate`` without parameters.
This will start the process in the foreground.

::

  sh$ ./bin/crate

You can also start Crate in the background using the ``-d`` option. When starting Crate
in the background it is helpful to write the process id into a pid file so you can find
out the process id easlily::

  sh$ ./bin/crate -d -p ./crate.pid

To stop the process that is running in the background send the
``TERM`` or ``INT`` signal to it.

::

  sh$ kill -TERM `cat ./crate.pid`


The ``crate`` executable supports the following command line options:


Command Line Options
====================

-d
    start the daemon in the background
-h
    print usage information
-p <pidfile>
    log the pid to a file
-v
    print version information
-D
    set a java system property value
-X
    set a nonstandard java option

Example::

  sh$ ./bin/crate -d -p ./crate.pid

Signal Handling
===============

The Crate process can handle the following signals.

+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| Signal    | Description                               |
+===========+===========================================+
| ``TERM``  | Stops a running Crate process             |
|           |                                           |
|           | ``kill -TERM `cat /path/to/pidfile.pid``` |
|           |                                           |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``INT``   | Stops a running Crate process             |
|           |                                           |
|           | Same behaviour as ``TERM``.               |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``USR2``  | Stops a running Crate process gracefully. |
|           | See :ref:`cluster_upgrade` for more       |
|           | information                               |
|           |                                           |
|           | ``kill -USR2 `cat /path/to/pidfile.pid``` |
|           |                                           |
|           | ``USR2`` is not supported on Windows.     |
|           |                                           |
