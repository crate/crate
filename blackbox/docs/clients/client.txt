Client Usage

Connect to a Database
=====================

The ``CrateClient`` class is used to connect to a Crate database. It requires
one or more hosts as arguments. Note that the Java client talks to Crate via the
transport port ``4300``.

Since Crate is a clustered database it is recommended to specify all the hosts
of the cluster. This way if a server is unavailable the host is skipped and the
request is automatically routed to the next server::


    import io.crate.client.CrateClient;

    CrateClient client = new CrateClient(
        "host1.example.com:4300",
        "host2.example.com:4300"
    );


Selecting Data
==============

Using the ``sql()`` method on the client class you can execute
simple SQL statements::

    SQLResponse response = client.sql("SELECT * FROM sys.nodes").actionGet()

Retrieving the returned columns using the ``cols()`` method::

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(response.cols()));

will print::

    ["id", "name", "hostname", "rest_url", "port", "load", "mem", "heap",
    "fs", "version", "thread_pools"]

Retrieving the returned rows using the ``rows()`` method::

    for (Object[] row: r.rows()){
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(row));
    }

will print (something like)::

    ["UhT82pZnQ3qT5EGasqs-nw", "host1", "host1.example.com", ...]
    ["aAKieK6zQDKX4iGkqHgM6Q", "host2", "host2.example.com", ...]
    ...


SQLRequest Class
================

By default, the column data types are not serialized. In order to retrieve
these, one must define it in the ``SQLRequest`` or ``SQLBulkRequest`` (see
:ref:`java_client_bulk`) object::

    SQLRequest request = new SQLRequest("SELECT name FROM sys.nodes");

If you want to retrieve the types of the columns in the ``SQLResponse``
or ``SQLBulkResponse`` object you'll need to set ``includeTypesOnResponse``::

    request.includeTypesOnResponse(true);

Now you're able to call ``sql()`` using the request object as its argument::

    SQLResponse response = client.sql(request).actionGet()

.. note::

   Queries are executed asynchronously. ``client.sql("...")`` will return a
   ``Future<SQLResponse>`` and code execution is only blocked if
   ``.actionGet()`` is called on it.


Get the data type of the first column::

    DataType dataType = r.columnTypes()[0]
    System.out.print(dataType.getName())

will print::

    "string"


Default Schema
--------------

In case the schema name isn't set explicitly in the statement Crate will
default to ``doc``. In order to overwrite that default it is possible to set
the default schema name on the ``SQLRequest``::

    SQLRequest request = new SQLRequest("select * from t");
    request.setDefaultSchema('custom_schema');

This will then return the results from ``custom_schema.t`` instead of
``doc.t``.

.. note::

    This is also supported on the SQLBulkRequest class that is described
    further below.


Parameter Substitution
======================

To prevent `SQL Injection`_ and for convenience reasons one always
should use parameter substitution when querying data.

In order to perform parameter substitution you can use the
``SQLRequest`` or the ``SQLBulkRequest`` (see :ref:`java_client_bulk`) class
again.

Here we'll create a table ``foo`` first and then insert data using parameter
substitution::

    client.sql("CREATE TABLE foo (id int primary key, name string)").actionGet()

    String stmt = "INSERT INTO foo (id, name) VALUES (?, ?)";
    Object[] args = new Object[]{1, "bar"};

    SQLRequest request = new SQLRequest(stmt, args);


Data Type Mapping
=================

The data type of columns in the ``SQLResponse`` or ``SQLBulkResponse`` are Crate
data types and map with the following native Java types.

========== =========
Crate Type Java Type
========== =========
string     String
short      Short
integer    Integer
long       Long
float      Float
double     Double
byte       Byte
boolean    Boolean
array      Array
object     Map
ip         String
timestamp  Double
geo_point  Double[2]
geo_shape  Map
========== =========

The mapping also works the other way round for parameter substitution.

Bulk Operations
===============

Using the SQLBulkRequest class allows to specify and issue bulk operations which
are executed as single calls on the back-end. It can be compared to `prepared
statement`_.

A bulk operation can be expressed simply as an SQL statement. Supported
statements are:

 - Insert

 - Update

 - Delete

In order to issue a bulk operation, the SQLBulkRequest class can be used
together with the ``bulkSql()`` method.

It accepts a two dimensional array (``bulkArgs`` of type Object[][]). The first
dimension consolidates all records to a bulk. The second dimension represents
one record and needs to match the specified parameters of a statement.

The following example describes how to issue an insert bulk operation and
insert three records at once::

    String stmt = "INSERT INTO foo (id, name) VALUES (?, ?)";
    Object[][] bulkArgs = new Object[][] {
        {1, "I am Batman!"},
        {2, "Deadpool"},
        {3, "Nancy Callahan"}
    };

    SQLBulkRequest request = new SQLBulkRequest(stmt, bulkArgs);
    client.bulkSql(request).actionGet();

.. note::

    When using bulk operations **all operations are executed** no matter what.
    It does not matter whether one single operation fails or all succeed.

The response is an instance of ``SQLBulkResponse``.
It contains the column names (using ``sqlBulkResponse.cols()``) and column data
types (using ``sqlBulkResponse.columnTypes()``) and an Array of ``Result``
instances which contain a ``rowCount`` per single bulk operation.

If a bulk operation failed, the attribute ``errorMessage`` is not null.

The insert operation above would contain three ``Result`` instances with the
following data::

    "{rowCount=1, errorMessage=null}"
