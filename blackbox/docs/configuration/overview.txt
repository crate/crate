Configuration Overview
======================

Since CrateDB has sensible defaults, there is no configuration needed at all
for basic operation.

CrateDB is mainly configured via a configuration file, which is located at
``config/crate.yml``. The vanilla configuration file distributed with the
package has all available settings as comments in it along with the according
default value.

The location of the config file can be specified upon startup like this::

    sh$ ./bin/crate -Cpath.conf=/path/to/config/directory

Any setting can be configured either by the config file or via the ``-C``
option upon startup.

For example, configuring the cluster name by using command line properties will
work this way::

    sh$ ./bin/crate -Ccluster.name=cluster

.. highlight:: yaml

This is exactly the same as setting the cluster name in the config file::

    cluster.name = cluster

Settings will get applied in the following order where the latter one will
overwrite the prior one:

 1. internal defaults
 2. options from config file
 3. command-line properties
