Authentication Methods
======================

There are multiple ways to authenticate against CrateDB.

.. NOTE::

   Authentication methods are an
   :ref:`enterprise feature <enterprise_features>`.

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB will never leak information about user existence in the case of
   failed authentication. If you're receiving an error trying to authenticate,
   first make sure that the user exists.

.. _auth_trust:

Trust Method
============

When the ``trust`` authentication method is used, the server just takes the
username provided by the client as is without further validation. This is
useful for any setup where access is controlled by other means, like network
restrictions as implemented by :ref:`admin_hba`.

Trust Authentication Over Postgres Protocol
-------------------------------------------

The Postgres Protocol requires a user for every connection which is sent by all
client implementations.

Trust Authentication Over HTTP
------------------------------

The HTTP implementation extracts the username from the
`HTTP Basic Authentication`_ request header.

Since a user is always required for trust authentication, it is possible to
specify a default user in case that the ``Authorization`` header is not set.
This is useful to allow clients which do not provide the possibility to set any
headers, for example a web browser connecting to the Admin UI.

.. _auth_trust_http_default_user:

The default user can be specified via the ``auth.trust.http_default_user``
setting like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    auth:
      trust:
        http_default_user: dustin



.. NOTE::

   When the Enterprise Edition, and the User Management are enabled,
   the user of the Admin UI needs to be granted the following privileges:
   ``DQL`` on ``sys.shards``, ``sys.nodes``, ``sys.node_checks``,
   ``sys.checks``, ``sys.cluster``, and ``sys.jobs_log`` tables.
   As well as ``DQL`` on the ``doc`` schema.

   These ``DQL`` privileges are required by the Admin UI to display the
   cluster health, monitoring,  and checks, to list the available nodes
   in the cluster and to list the tables.

.. _auth_password:

Password Authentication Method
==============================

When the ``password`` authentication method is used, the client has to provide
a password additionally to the username. The password is sent from the client
to the server in **clear text**, which means that unless SSL is enabled, the
password could potentially be read by anyone sniffing the network.

.. NOTE::

   For HTTP, the password must be encoded together with the username with
   `BASE64_` and sent together prefixed with ``Basic `` as string value for
   the ``Authorization`` HTTP header. See also: `HTTP Basic Authentication`_.

.. NOTE::

   **CrateDB does not store user passwords as clear text!**

   CrateDB stores user passwords salted with a per-user salt and hashed using
   the PBKDF2_ key derivation function and the `SHA-512 hash algorithm`_.

.. _auth_cert:

Client Certificate Authentication Method
========================================

When the ``cert`` authentication method is used, the client has to connect to
CrateDB using SSL with a valid client certificate.

If connecting via HTTP where the username is optional, the ``common name`` will
be used as username. In case a username is already provided, it has to match
the ``common name`` of the certificate. Otherwise the authentication will fail.
See :ref:`auth_trust` on how to provide a username via HTTP.

The rule that the ``common name`` must match the provided username always
applies to the postgres wire protocol, as there the username isn't optional.

Please consult the relevant client documentations for instructions on how to
connect using SSL with client certificate.
