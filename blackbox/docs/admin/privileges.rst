Introduction
============

The superuser uses ``GRANT``, ``DENY`` and ``REVOKE`` statements to control
access to the resource. The privileges are either applied on the whole cluster
or on instances of objects such as schema, or table.

.. NOTE::

   Privileges are an
   :ref:`enterprise feature <enterprise_features>`.

   When the CrateDB Enterprise Edition is disabled, there will be no user
   privilege checks, and every statement will be executed without the
   validation of privileges.

.. NOTE::

   Superusers are allowed to execute any statement without any privilege
   checks.

   Currently only ``DQL``, ``DML`` and ``DDL`` privileges can be granted. Any
   statements which are not allowed with those privileges, such as ``GRANT``,
   ``DENY`` and ``REVOKE``, can only be issued by a superuser.

Privilege Types
===============

``DQL``
.......

Granting ``Data Query Language (DQL)`` privilege to a user, indicates that this
user is allowed to execute ``SELECT``, ``SHOW``, ``REFRESH``, ``COPY TO``,
and ``SET SESSION`` statements, as well as using the available user defined
functions, on the object for which the privilege applies.

``DML``
.......

Granting ``Data Manipulation Language (DML)`` privilege to a user, indicates
that this user is allowed to execute ``INSERT``, ``COPY FROM``, ``UPDATE``
and ``DELETE`` statements, on the object for which the privilege applies.

``DDL``
.......

Granting ``Data Definition Language (DDL)`` privilege to a user, indicates that
this user is allowed to execute ``CREATE TABLE``, ``DROP TABLE``,
``CREATE FUNCTION``, ``DROP FUNCTION``, ``CREATE REPOSITORY``,
``DROP REPOSITORY``, ``CREATE SNAPSHOT``, ``DROP SNAPSHOT``,
``RESTORE SNAPSHOT``, and ``ALTER`` statements, on the object for which the
privilege applies.

.. _hierarchical_privileges_inheritance:

Hierarchical Inheritance of Privileges
======================================
.. hide:

    cr> CREATE user riley;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

    cr> CREATE user kala;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

    cr> create table if not exists doc.accounting (
    ...   first_column integer primary key,
    ...   second_column string,
    ...   third_column timestamp,
    ...   fourth_column object(strict) as (
    ...     key string,
    ...     value string
    ...   )
    ... ) clustered by (first_column) into 5 shards;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

Privileges can be managed on three different levels, namely: ``CLUSTER``,
``SCHEMA`` and ``TABLE``.

When a privilege is assigned on a certain level, the privilege will propagate
down the hierarchy. Privileges defined on a lower level will always override
those from a higher level. For example::

This statement will grant ``DQL`` privilege to user riley on all the tables
and functions of the ``doc`` schema::

    cr> GRANT DQL ON SCHEMA doc TO riley;
    GRANT OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

This statement will deny ``DQL`` privilege to user riley on the ``doc`` schema
table ``doc.accounting``. However, user riley, will still have ``DQL``
privilege on all the other tables of the ``doc`` schema::

    cr> DENY DQL ON TABLE doc.accounting TO riley;
    DENY OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

.. NOTE::

    In CrateDB, schemas are just namespaces that are created and dropped
    implicitly. Therefore, when ``GRANT``, ``DENY`` or ```REVOKE`` are invoked
    on a schema level, CrateDB takes the schema name provided without further
    validation.

.. NOTE::

    Privileges can be managed on all schemas and tables of the cluster,
    except the ``information_schema``.

Behavior of ``GRANT``, ``DENY`` and ``REVOKE``
==============================================

.. NOTE::

    Stale permissions might be introduced if ``DDL`` statements were invoked
    while the Enterprise Edition is temporarily disabled. To allow clients
    to remove such stale permissions even, if the table does not exist anymore,
    the ``REVOKE`` statement does not perform any validation checks on the
    table ident.

``GRANT``
.........

.. hide:

    cr> CREATE user wolfgang;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

    cr> CREATE user will;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

    cr> create table if not exists doc.books (
    ...   first_column integer primary key,
    ...   second_column string,
    ...   third_column timestamp,
    ...   fourth_column object(strict) as (
    ...     key string,
    ...     value string
    ...   )
    ... ) clustered by (first_column) into 5 shards;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

To grant a privilege to an existing user on the whole cluster,
we use the :ref:`ref-grant` SQL statement, for example::

    cr> GRANT DML TO wolfgang;
    GRANT OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

``DQL`` privilege can be granted on the sys schema to user wolfgang,
like this::

    cr> GRANT DQL ON SCHEMA sys TO wolfgang;
    GRANT OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

The following statement will grant all privileges on table doc.books to user
wolfgang::

    cr> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE doc.books TO wolfgang;
    GRANT OK, 3 rows affected (... sec)

Using "ALL PRIVILEGES" is a shortcut to grant all the currently grantable
privileges to a user, namely ``DQL``, ``DML`` and ``DDL``.

.. NOTE::

    If no schema is specified in the table ``ident``, the table will be
    looked up in the current schema.

If a user with the username specified in the SQL statement does not exist the
statement returns an error::

    cr> GRANT DQL TO layla;
    SQLActionException[UserUnknownException: User 'layla' does not exist]

To grant ``ALL PRIVILEGES`` to user will on the cluster, we can use the
following syntax::

    cr> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO will;
    GRANT OK, 3 rows affected (... sec)

Using ``ALL PRIVILEGES`` is a shortcut to grant all the currently grantable
privileges to a user, namely ``DQL``, ``DML`` and ``DDL``.

Privileges can be granted to multiple users in the same statement, like so::

    cr> GRANT DDL ON TABLE doc.books TO wolfgang, will;
    GRANT OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

``DENY``
........

To deny a privilege to an existing user on the whole cluster, use the
:ref:`ref-deny` SQL statement, for example::

    cr> DENY DDL TO will;
    DENY OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

``DQL`` privilege can be denied on the sys schema to user wolfgang,
like this::

    cr> DENY DQL ON SCHEMA sys TO wolfgang;
    DENY OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

The following statement will deny ``DQL`` privilege on table doc.books to user
wolfgang::

    cr> DENY DQL ON TABLE doc.books TO wolfgang;
    DENY OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

``DENY ALL`` or ``DENY ALL PRIVILEGES`` will deny all privileges to a user,
on the cluster it can be used like this::

    cr> DENY ALL TO will;
    DENY OK, 2 rows affected (... sec)

``REVOKE``
..........

To revoke a privilege that was previously granted or denied to a user use the
:ref:`ref-revoke` SQL statement, for example the ``DQL`` privilege that was
previously denied to user wolfgang on the *sys* schema, can be revoked like
this::

    cr> REVOKE DQL ON SCHEMA sys FROM wolfgang;
    REVOKE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

The privileges that were granted and denied to user wolfgang on doc.books
can be revoked like this::

    cr> REVOKE ALL ON TABLE doc.books FROM wolfgang;
    REVOKE OK, 3 rows affected (... sec)

The privileges that were granted to user will on the cluster can be revoked
like this::

    cr> REVOKE ALL FROM will;
    REVOKE OK, 3 rows affected (... sec)

.. NOTE::

    The ``REVOKE`` statement can remove only privileges that have been granted
    or denied through the ``GRANT`` or ``DENY`` statements. If the privilege
    on a specific object was not explicitly granted, the ``REVOKE`` statement
    has no effect. The effect of the ``REVOKE`` statement will be reflected
    in the row count.

List Privileges
===============

CrateDB exposes privileges ``sys.privileges`` system table.

By querying the ``sys.privileges`` table you can get all
information regarding the existing privileges. E.g.::

    cr> SELECT * FROM sys.privileges order by grantee, class, ident;
    +---------+----------+---------+----------------+-------+------+
    | class   | grantee  | grantor | ident          | state | type |
    +---------+----------+---------+----------------+-------+------+
    | SCHEMA  | riley    | crate   | doc            | GRANT | DQL  |
    | TABLE   | riley    | crate   | doc.accounting | DENY  | DQL  |
    | TABLE   | will     | crate   | doc.books      | GRANT | DDL  |
    | CLUSTER | wolfgang | crate   | NULL           | GRANT | DML  |
    +---------+----------+---------+----------------+-------+------+
    SELECT 4 rows in set (... sec)

The column ``grantor`` shows the user who granted or denied the privilege,
the column ``grantee`` shows the user for whom the privilege was granted
or denied. The column ``class`` identifies on which type of context the
privilege applies. ``ident`` stands for the ident of the object that the
privilege is set on and finally ``type`` stands for the type of privileges that
was granted or denied.
