Introduction
============

A CrateDB cluster contains a set of database users. A database user is a
principle at cluster level.

User account information is stored in the cluster metatdata of CrateDB and
supports the following statements to create, alter and drop users:

    * `CREATE USER`_
    * `ALTER USER`_
    * `DROP USER`_

These statements are database management statements that can only be invoked by
superusers that already exist in the CrateDB cluster. Also the users table
`sys.users` is only readable by superusers.

When CrateDB is started, the cluster contains one predefined superuser. This
user is called ``crate``. It is not possible to create any other superusers

Users cannot be backed up or restored.

``CREATE USER``
===============

To create a new user for the CrateDB database cluster use the
:ref:`ref-create-user` SQL statement::

    cr> CREATE USER user_a;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

The newly created user does not have any special :ref:`administration-privileges`.
It can be used to connect to the database cluster using available authentication
methods. You can specify the user's password in the ``WITH`` clause of the
``CREATE`` statement. This is required if you want to use the
:ref:`auth_password`::

    cr> CREATE USER user_b WITH (password = 'a_secret_password');
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

The username parameter of the statement follows the principles of an identifier
which means that it must be double-quoted if it contains special characters
(e.g. whitespace) or if the case needs to be maintained::

    cr> CREATE USER "Custom User";
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

If a user with the username specified in the SQL statement already exists the
statement returns an error::

    cr> CREATE USER "Custom User";
    SQLActionException[UserAlreadyExistsException: User 'Custom User' already exists]


``ALTER USER``
==============

To alter the password for an existing user from the CrateDB database cluster use
the :ref:`ref-alter-user` SQL statement::

    cr> ALTER USER user_a SET (password = 'pass');
    ALTER OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

The password can be reset (cleared) if specified as ``NULL``::

    cr> ALTER USER user_a SET (password = NULL);
    ALTER OK, 1 row affected (... sec)


``DROP USER``
=============

.. hide:

    cr> CREATE USER user_c;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

To remove an existing user from the CrateDB database cluster use the
:ref:`ref-drop-user` SQL statement::

    cr> DROP USER user_c;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

If a user with the username specified in the SQL statement does not exist the
statement returns an error::

    cr> DROP USER user_c;
    SQLActionException[UserUnknownException: User 'user_c' does not exist]

It is not possible to drop the built-in superuser ``crate``.

List Users
==========

CrateDB exposes database users via the read-only ``sys.users`` system table.
The ``sys.users`` table shows all users in the cluster which can be used for
authentication. The initial superuser ``crate`` which is available for all
CrateDB clusters is also part of that list.

To list all existing users query that table::

    cr> SELECT * FROM sys.users order by name;
    +-------------+----------+-----------+
    | name        | password | superuser |
    +-------------+----------+-----------+
    | Custom User |     NULL | FALSE     |
    | crate       |     NULL | TRUE      |
    | user_a      |     NULL | FALSE     |
    | user_b      | ******** | FALSE     |
    +-------------+----------+-----------+
    SELECT 4 rows in set (... sec)

The column ``name`` shows the unique name of the user, the column ``superuser``
shows whether the user has superuser privileges or not.

.. NOTE::

    CrateDB also supports retrieving the current connected user using the
    system information functions: :ref:`CURRENT_USER <current_user>`,
    :ref:`USER <user>` and :ref:`SESSION_USER <session_user>`.

.. WARNING::

   When the :ref:`es_api_setting` is enabled, it is possible to read the users
   data via the Elasticsearch API. Therefore access to the users table is not
   restricted.
