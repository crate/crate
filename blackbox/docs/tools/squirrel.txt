=============================
Using Crate with SQuirreL SQL
=============================

**`SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`__** is a graphical SQL client
application that can be used to browse and query a JDBC compliant
database.

As Crate supports JDBC with its Crate JDBC driver, it can easily be used
with SQUirreL.

Setup
-----

`SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`__ does not provide a Crate
driver with its distribution, so an extra setup step is required to run
Crate with `SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`__:

1. Copy the `Crate JDBC
   standalone <https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view/files/io/crate/crate-jdbc-standalone>`__
   jar to the SQuirreL lib folder. On OS X, when installing SQuirreL
   with the MaxOS X installer, this is
   ``/Applications/SQuirreLSQL.app/Contents/Resources/Java/lib/``

2. Start `SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`__.

3. Choose the ``Drivers`` tab and add a new driver, adding the following
   information into the form and confirm by pressing ok. [squirrel add
   driver dialogue]({% media '/media/1602/squirrel\_add\_driver.png' %})

4. Choose the ``Aliases`` tab and add a new Alias, Choose your new
   driver (called crate in our example) and enter your database URL.
   Username and password are not supported, so leave them blank.
   [squirrel add alias dialogue]({% media
   '/media/1602/squirrel\_add\_alias.png' %})

5. Connect your alias to your crate instance.

Usage
-----

You can browse Crate using the Object Tree Worksheet, that is the usual
view you use for browsing your tables and get information about their
schema.

When browsing a tableâ€™s content using Content, it is possible to edit
the table contents by right-clicking and choosing Make Editable.

Using the SQuirreL SQL Editor it is possible to execute arbitrary SQL
commands and scripts.
