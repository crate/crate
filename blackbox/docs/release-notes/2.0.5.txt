.. _version_2.0.5:

=============
Version 2.0.5
=============

Released on 2017/07/11.

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB
   :ref:`version_1.1.3` or higher before you upgrade to 2.0.5.

   If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
   number must be :ref:`version_2.0.0`. If you want to upgrade from a version
   prior to this, the upgrade will introduce all of the breaking changes listed
   for :ref:`version_2.0.0`, and will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

   Consult the :ref:`version_2.0.0_upgrade_notes` for ``2.0.0`` when upgrading.

.. WARNING::

   If you're using CrateDB's BLOB storage you should consult the
   `Upgrade Notes`_.

.. WARNING::

   Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Upgrade Notes
=============

Due to a bug introduced in :ref:`version_2.0.0` that can cause loss of BLOB
data, it is necessary to perform a `rolling upgrade`_ if you're running a
version >= 2.0.0 and < 2.0.4 and using BLOB tables.

Additionally, the number of replicas needs to be set to at least ``1`` for
**all** blob tables and you need to make sure that data is fully replicated
before continuing.

Only then you may upgrade one node after each other.

Changelog
=========

Fixes
-----

 - Fixed an issue that caused an exception to be thrown when using
   ``COUNT(*)`` with a ``JOIN`` on 3 or more tables.

 - Fixed a regression that caused queries with a ``GROUP BY`` on array-columns,
   which are wrapped in a scalar function, to fail.

 - Fixed an issue that caused an exception if a table that has been created
   with CrateDB version <= 1.1 is modified using ``ALTER TABLE``.
