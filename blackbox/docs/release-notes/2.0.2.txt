Fixes
-----

 - Fixed an issue that caused an exception to be thrown when applying
   aggregations on generated columns of a table.

 - Fixed a bug in the memory accounting of the circuit breaker for HTTP
   results when querying for columns of undefined type.

 - Fixed wrong results when querying ``IS NULL`` on an array of objects.

 - Fixed issue that caused an exception when querying the ``_id`` column using
   all defined primary keys inside the ``WHERE`` clause over the HTTP API.

 - Fixed an issue that caused an Exception to be thrown on ``JOIN`` queries
   with 4 or more tables when an ``ORDER BY`` is also applied.

 - Fixed an issue that resulted in rows being unable to be queried by primary
   keys, when the order of the primary key columns on insert differed from
   the order of the primary key columns on the table definition.
   Note: If records are already inserted by using a different primary key
   column order, they must be re-inserted, otherwise queries will still fail
   for these rows.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause ``DELETE`` by query  and ``UPDATE``
   statements to fail on datasets larger than 10,000 rows.

 - Improved the resiliency of queries on ``sys.nodes``: If a node disconnects
   during the execution of a query it will no longer fail.

 - Added proper handling when memory requirements of a ``JOIN`` query exceeds
   the available memory. Instead of having OutOfMemoryException thrown which
   led to killed nodes in the cluster, the issue is detected and the query is
   killed without affecting the cluster.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause ``DELETE`` statements to fail instead of
   "not matching" if there was a ``_version`` column in the ``WHERE`` clause.

 - Fixed an error handling issue that could lead to the termination of a node
   in very rare cases. (Usually if a user invoked the ``KILL`` statement)

 - Fixed issue where bulk operations like ``INSERT`` from dynamic queries and
   ``COPY FROM`` did not stop after being killed.

 - ``CREATE USER`` and ``DROP USER`` statements will now only respond after all
   nodes in the cluster have processed the change.

 - Fixed an issue that caused an exception to be thrown when using ``unnest``
   with 10 or more columns.
