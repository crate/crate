EC2 Discovery
=============

CrateDB has native discovery support when running a cluster on Amazon
infrastructure. Since EC2 does not support multicast (which, in any case, was
deprecated in CrateDB 1.0.3 and will be removed in CrateDB 1.1) the discovery
mechanism uses the `EC2 API`_ to look up other EC2 hosts that are then used as
unicast hosts for node discovery (see
:ref:`conf_discovery`).

There is a :ref:`best practice <ec2_setup>` how to configure and run a CrateDB
cluster on Amazon EC2.

Azure Discovery
===============

CrateDB has native discovery support when running a cluster on `Microsoft
Azure`_ infrastructure. Since Azure does not support multicast (which, in any
case, was deprecated in CrateDB 1.0.3 and will be removed in CrateDB 1.1) the
discovery mechanism uses the ARM (Azure Resource Management) mode APIs to
generate the list of hosts for the unicast host discovery.

The discovery mechanism is implemented as a plugin and resides within the plugin
folder of the CrateDB installation. However, since the Azure Java SDKs does have
a lot of dependencies and we want to keep the plugin jar small in size the
dependencies are not included in the CrateDB distribution.

Requirements
------------

To make the plugin work you have to add the following Java libraries to the
``$CRATE_HOME/plugins/crate-azure-discovery`` folder::

    activation-1.1.jar
    adal4j-1.0.0.jar
    azure-core-0.9.3.jar
    azure-mgmt-compute-0.9.3.jar
    azure-mgmt-network-0.9.3.jar
    azure-mgmt-resources-0.9.3.jar
    azure-mgmt-storage-0.9.3.jar
    azure-mgmt-utility-0.9.3.jar
    bcprov-jdk15on-1.51.jar
    commons-io-2.4.jar
    commons-lang-2.6.jar
    commons-lang3-3.3.1.jar
    gson-2.2.4.jar
    jackson-core-asl-1.9.2.jar
    jackson-jaxrs-1.9.2.jar
    jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.2.jar
    jackson-xc-1.9.2.jar
    javax.inject-1.jar
    jaxb-api-2.2.2.jar
    jaxb-impl-2.2.3-1.jar
    jcip-annotations-1.0.jar
    jersey-client-1.13.jar
    jersey-core-1.13.jar
    jersey-json-1.13.jar
    jettison-1.1.jar
    json-smart-1.1.1.jar
    lang-tag-1.4.jar
    mail-1.4.7.jar
    nimbus-jose-jwt-3.1.2.jar
    oauth2-oidc-sdk-4.5.jar
    stax-api-1.0-2.jar

You can download the libraries using a simple ``build.gradle`` file:

.. code-block:: groovy

    apply plugin: "java"

    repositories {
      jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile('com.microsoft.azure:azure-mgmt-utility:0.9.3') {
            exclude group: 'stax', module: 'stax-api'
            exclude group: 'org.slf4j', module: 'slf4j-api'
            exclude group: 'commons-logging', module: 'commons-logging'
            exclude group: 'commons-codec', module: 'commons-codec'
            exclude group: 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core', module: 'jackson-core'
            exclude group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents', module: 'httpclient'
        }
    }

    task azureLibs (type: Copy, dependsOn: ['compileJava']) {
      from configurations.testRuntime
      into "libs"
    }

Running ``gradle azureLibs`` will fetch the required jars and put them into the
``libs/`` folder from where you can copy them into the plugin folder.

Basic Configuration
-------------------

To enable Azure discovery simply change the ``discovery.type`` setting to
``azure``::

    discovery.type: azure

The discovery mechanism can discover CrateDB instances within the same **vnet**
or the same **subnet** of the same **resource group**. By default it will the
**vnet**.

You can change the behaviour using the ``discovery.azure.method`` setting::

    discovery.azure.method: subnet

The used resource group also needs to be provided::

    cloud.azure.management.resourcegroup.name: production

Authentication
--------------

The discovery plugin requires authentication as service principle.
To do so, you have to create an ``Active Directory`` application with a password.
We recommened to follow the `AD Application Guide`_ .

The configuration settings for authentication are as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    cloud.azure.management:
      subscription.id: my-id
      tenant.id: my-tenant
      app:
        id: my-app
        secret: my-secret

For a complete list of settings please refer to :ref:`conf_azure_discovery`.
