Usage Data Collector
====================

The Crate Usage Data Collector (UDC) is a sub-system that gathers
usage data, reporting it to the UDC server at https://udc.crate.io.
It is easy to disable, and does not collect any data that is confidential.
For more information about what is being sent, see below.

Crate uses this information as a form of automatic, effortless feedback from the
community. We want to verify that we are doing the right thing by matching
download statistics with usage statistics. After each release, we can see if
there is a larger retention span of the server software.

The data collected is clearly stated here. If any future versions of this system
collect additional data, we will clearly announce those changes.

Crate is very concerned about your privacy. We do not disclose any personally
identifiable information.

Technical Information
=====================
To gather good statistics about Crate usage, UDC collects this information:

    ================  =============================================================================
    Name              Description
    ================  =============================================================================
    Kernel Version    The build number, and if there are any modifications to the kernel.
    Cluster Id        A randomized globally unique id created every time the whole cluster is
                      restarted.
    Master            Boolean whether the current node is master.
    Ping Count        UDC holds an internal counter per node which is incremented for every ping,
                      and reset on every restart of the a node.
    Crate Version     The crate version.
    Java Version      The Java version crate is currently running with.
    Hardware Address  MAC address to uniquely identify instances behind firewalls.
    ================  =============================================================================

After startup, UDC waits for 10 minutes before sending the first ping. It does
this for two reasons; first, we don't want the startup to be slower because of
UDC, and secondly, we want to keep pings from automatic tests to a minimum. By
default, UDC is sending pings every 24 hours. The ping to the UDC servers is
done with a HTTP GET.

Admin UI tracking
=================
Since Admin UI v0.16.0 we are tracking the user-id along with the cluster-id to 
know how many active users are currently using Crate.

Configuration
=============
The Usage Data Collector can be configured by adapting the ``crate.yml``
configuration file or adding a system property setting. Refer to
:ref:`conf_usage_data_collector` to see how these settings can be accessed and
how they are configured.

How to disable UDC
==================
Below are two ways you can disable UDC. However we hope you support us offering
the open source edition, and leave UDC on, so we learn how many people use
Crate.

.. note::

    If UDC is disabled on the Crate server the Intercom service is deactivated.

By configuration
----------------
Just add following to your ``crate.yml`` configuration file::

    udc.enabled:  false

By system property
-------------------------
If you do not want to make any change to the jars or to the configuration,
a system property setting like this will also make sure that UDC is never
activated::

    -Des.udc.enabled=false
