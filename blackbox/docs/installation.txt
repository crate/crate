============
Installation
============

This section describes how to install Crate on a single node. In order to
get a Crate cluster up and running it is enough to repeat the process on
another machine if the network supports multicast. The Nodes will discover and
form a cluster automatically. Just like magic.

In case the network doesn't support multicast, a unicast configuration is
required. Please refer to our article on `Multi Node Setup`_ in order to learn
how to setup the unicast configuration.

Java (JVM) version
==================

Crate requires a working `Java 8`_ virtual machine. We recommend
using `Oracle's Java`_ on OSX and OpenJDK_ on Linux Systems.
The same JVM version must be used on all Crate nodes and clients.

We recommend installing `Java 8`_ update 20 or later.

.. _install_targz:

Install via tar.gz
==================

.. highlight:: sh

After downloading the latest stable version of Crate from
`https://crate.io/download/ <https://crate.io/download/>`_
the package needs to be unpacked::

   sh$ tar zxf crate-*.tar.gz
   sh$ cd crate-*

Once unpacked Crate can be started in the foreground like this::

   sh$ ./bin/crate

In order to start in the background add the ``-d`` option. If started in the
foreground you can use ``Control-C`` to stop the process again.


The Crate Shell (Crash) is shipped with the tarball distribution.
You can start the shell using the ``crash`` command::

  sh$ ./bin/crash

The Crate distribution also comes with a web based administration
interface. It is served on port ``4200`` and you can access it with
your browser once Crate is started::

  http://host1.example.com:4200/admin/

**The admin interface runs on each node where Crate is installed.**


Install using Docker
====================

`Docker`_ is a lightweigt runtime to run distributed applications in a sandboxed container.
We provide a Docker image for Crate for easy installation::

    sh$ docker pull crate
    sh$ docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 crate crate -Des.cluster.name=my_cluster

The images are hosted on the `Docker Hub Registry`_. There is additional information
on how to run Crate in a Docker container on the `docker-crate`_ Github repository.

.. _install_production:

Install Crate for Production
============================

We provide distributions for **RHEL/YUM** based systems, **Ubuntu**, **Debian** and **Arch Linux**.

You can find instruction how to install Crate for production on
the Download_ page.

In case your distribution is missing feel free to `contact us
<https://crate.io/about/contact/>`_. We're happy to create and maintain
additional packages if we see enough interest.
