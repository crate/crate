============
Installation
============

This page documents the most basic sort of CrateDB installation.

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB comes pre-packaged for many Linux systems, Docker, and cloud hosting
   providers. There is also a handy one-line command that let's you download
   and run CrateDB on Mac OS X.

   To learn more, check out the `install section`_ of the CrateDB Guide.

Prerequisites
=============

CrateDB requires `Java 8`_. We recommend using `Oracle's Java`_ on OSX and
OpenJDK_ on Linux Systems.

The same JVM version must be used on all CrateDB nodes.

We recommend installing `Java 8`_ update 20 or later.

Download
========

Download `the latest CrateDB release`_.

.. TIP::

   Older releases of CrateDB are `also available`_.


Once downloaded, unpack the tarball and change into the resulting directory::

   sh$ tar -xzf crate-*.tar.gz
   sh$ cd crate-*

Run
===

There is no need to configure or build anything.

Once unpacked, CrateDB can be started in the foreground like this::

   sh$ ./bin/crate

This runs a single instance of CrateDB that is bound the local IP address.

:kbd:`Control-C` will stop the process.

Pass the ``--help`` option for command usage information::

   sh$ ./bin/crate --help

.. SEEALSO::

 :ref:`cli`

 :ref:`configuration`

Connect
=======

The CrateDB Shell (aka `Crash`_) is shipped with the tarball distribution.

Start the shell like so::

  sh$ ./bin/crash

CrateDB also comes with a `web administration interface`_ served on port
``4200``.

Visit the admin interface in your browser at a URL like this one::

  http://localhost:4200/


.. NOTE::

    The admin interface runs on each CrateDB node.

.. NOTE::

    If port ``4200`` is accessed via libraries or the command line, the request
    will be handled by `the CrateDB Rest API`_, and the response will be JSON.
