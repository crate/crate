============
Installation
============

This section shows you how to install CrateDB on a single node.

To set up a multi-node cluster, you will need to tell CrateDB how to find the
other nodes. See the `Multi Node Setup`_ article for more information.

Java (JVM) Version
==================

CrateDB requires `Java 8`_. We recommend using `Oracle's Java`_ on OSX and
OpenJDK_ on Linux Systems.
The same JVM version must be used on all CrateDB nodes.

We recommend installing `Java 8`_ update 20 or later.

.. _install_targz:

Install Via Tarball
===================

.. highlight:: sh

After downloading the latest stable version of CrateDB from
`crate.io/download/ <https://crate.io/download/>`_
the package needs to be unpacked::

   sh$ tar zxf crate-*.tar.gz
   sh$ cd crate-*

Once unpacked CrateDB can be started in the foreground like this::

   sh$ ./bin/crate

In order to start in the background add the ``-d`` option. If started in the
foreground you can use ``Control-C`` to stop the process again.


The CrateDB Shell (Crash) is shipped with the tarball distribution.
You can start the shell using the ``crash`` command::

  sh$ ./bin/crash

The CrateDB distribution also comes with a web based administration
interface. It is served on port ``4200`` and you can access it with
your browser once Crate is started::

  http://host1.example.com:4200/

.. note::

    The admin interface runs on each node where CrateDB is installed.

.. note::

    If the previous URL is accessed via libraries (eg. cURL), or via offline
    browsers (eg. wget) the request will be handled by the CrateDB Rest API,
    and the response will be JSON.

Install Using Docker
====================

`Docker`_ is a lightweigt runtime to run distributed applications in a sandboxed container.
We provide a Docker image for CrateDB for easy installation::

    sh$ docker pull crate
    sh$ docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 crate crate -Ccluster.name=my_cluster

The images are hosted on the `Docker Hub Registry`_. There is additional information
on how to run Crate in a Docker container on the `docker-crate`_ Github repository.

.. _install_production:

Install CrateDB for Production
==============================

We provide distributions for **RHEL/YUM** based systems, **Ubuntu**, **Debian** and **Arch Linux**.

You can find instruction how to install CrateDB for production on
the Download_ page.

In case your distribution is missing feel free to `contact us
<https://crate.io/about/contact/>`_. We're happy to create and maintain
additional packages if we see enough interest.
