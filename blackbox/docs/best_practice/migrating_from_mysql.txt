Migrating From MySQL
====================

There are various ways to migrate your existing data from MySQL_ to CrateDB_.
However, these methods may differ in performance. A fast and reliable way to
migrate is to use CrateDB's existing export and import tools.

This best practice example shows how to migrate your data without any hassle.

We are assuming we have an existing table ``foo`` in MySQL with the following
schema::

  cr> CREATE TABLE foo (
  ...  id integer primary key,
  ...  name varchar(255),
  ...  date datetime,
  ...  fruits set('apple', 'pear', 'banana')
  ... ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;

Sample data::

  cr> INSERT INTO foo (id, name, date, fruits)
  ...  VALUES (1, 'foo', '2014-10-31 09:22:56', 'apple,banana'),
  ...   (2, 'bar', null, 'pear');

Exporting Data From MySQL
=========================

MySQL does not support ``JSON`` as an output format, but it is possible to
write to a file using the ``csv`` format.

Example::

  cr> SELECT id, name
  ...  INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/dump.csv'
  ...   CHARACTER SET utf8
  ...   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
  ...   LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
  ...  FROM foo;

Make sure fields are seperated by a comma (``,``), that values are quoted with
a pair of ``"`` and that lines are terminated by the newline character ``\n``.

Note that we specify ``utf8`` as encoding for writing into the outfile. This is
important because CrateDB requires ``utf8`` encoding.

You may need to set the character encoding of the client and ``mysqld`` in the
``my.cnf``, too:

.. code-block:: ini

  [client]
  default-character-set=utf8
  [mysqld]
  character-set-server=utf8

All values written to ``csv`` are quoted and therefore interpreted as strings
when read from the convert script later.

Date/Time Types
---------------

The standard output for `date/time types in MySQL
<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/date-and-time-types.html>`_ is a
string, However, CrateDB uses a ``long`` type to store timestamps (millisecond
precision). To prevent problems with dates that have timezone information, use
MySQL's builtin ``UNIX_TIMESTAMP`` function to convert ``date``, ``time``,
``datetime``, ``timestamp`` and ``year`` types into UNIX timestamps directly in
the ``SELECT`` statement.

The output of this function must be multiplied by ``1000`` (converting ``s`` to
``ms``) to obtain the correct ``long`` value that can be used for importing
into CrateDB.

::

  cr> SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP(datetime_column)*1000 from table_name;

Final export query::

  cr> SELECT id, name, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date)*1000, fruits
  ...  INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/dump.csv'
  ...    CHARACTER SET utf8
  ...    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
  ...    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
  ...  FROM foo;

Converting CSV to JSON
======================

Use the Python script (`csv2json.py`_) to convert the exported CSV file into a
CrateDB compatible JSON file. The source file needs to be ``utf8`` encoded.

The script requires ``csv`` input from ``stdin`` and prints the converted lines
to ``stdout``. Each line is a separate JSON string.

The ``--columns`` argument specifies the column names and column types for the
conversion.

The format for this argument is:

.. code-block:: sh

  column_name:column_type

where ``column_name`` must match the column name and ``column_type`` must match
the JSON type that the value should be converted to. Supported ``column_type``
values are:

.. code-block:: sh

  string
  short
  int
  integer
  long
  float
  double
  array
  timestamp (same as long)

For our example the usage looks like:

.. code-block:: sh

  sh$ cat /tmp/dump.csv | python mysql2crate.py - \
  ...     --columns id:int name:str date:timestamp fruits:array > /tmp/import.json

For help use the ``-h`` option:

.. code-block:: sh

  sh$ python mysql2crate.py -h

Importing Data Into CrateDB
===========================

The column names need to match the names specified by the ``--columns``
argument.

::

  cr> CREATE TABLE foo_imported (
  ...  id int,
  ...  name string,
  ...  date timestamp,
  ...  fruits array(string)
  ... );

Finally use the ``COPY FROM`` statement to import your newly generated json
file into CrateDB.

::

  cr> COPY foo_imported FROM '/tmp/import.json' WITH (bulk_size=1000);

.. NOTE::

   Read :ref:`efficient_data_import` for more information how to import huge
   datasets into CrateDB.

Third Party Tool: csvkit
========================

The tools provided by `csvkit`_ allow you to directly insert CSV data into
CrateDB via SQLAlchemy, using CrateDB’s native driver to create the table,
guess the corresponding data types, and insert any data found in the CSV file.

The simplest way to do so is like this:

.. code-block:: sh

  sh$ csvsql --db crate://localhost:4200 --insert /tmp/dump.csv

.. NOTE::

  See also the documentation of `csvsql`_. To use the SQLAlchemy driver of
  CrateDB, the latest version of the `CrateDB Python package`_ is required.
