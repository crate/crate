Launching EC2 Instances with the CrateDB AMI
=============================================

CrateDB provides custom public `AMI`_ s that can be launched by every EC2 user
by using the AWS Management Console or `AWS CLI`_. The naming convention is as
follows::

    crate-<VERSION>-<REVISION>-<AMI_REVISION>-<BASE_AMI>

``<VERSION>-<REVISION>`` is the CrateDB version and its revision in the format
``w.x.y-z``, ``<AMI_REVISION>`` is the AMI build revision and ``<BASE_AMI>`` is
the full name of the  `Amazon Linux`_ base image.

Example::

    crate-0.51.1-1-1-amzn-ami-hvm-2015.03.0.x86_64

The CrateDB AMI is based on comes with Java 8 and CrateDB pre-installed.

Finding the CrateDB AMI
=======================

To launch an EC2 instance based on the CrateDB AMI, use the search panel to
find the image in the public AMI repository. After choosing the desired AMI by
its CrateDB version, it can be launched as an EC2 instance running on your
account.

   :width: 100%

If you are using the `AWS CLI`_ you can find the public CrateDB AMI by using
the ``describe-images`` command. The easiest way to search for it is by using
its ``AMI Name``. AMIs are listed in JSON-format and sorted by their creation
date. The following command lists every available CrateDB AMI on the AWS
platform.

::

    sh$ aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=name,Values=crate-0.51.1-*"

Launch the AMI
==============

You can launch one or more instances with the CrateDB AMI using the
``run-instances`` command utilizing the ``--image-id`` command line option.
You can use the parameters of the command to configure its start-up behavior
and hardware configuration. A valid key-pair is necessary to connect to the
instances later.

::

    sh$ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <AMI-ID> --count <NR-OF-INSTANCES> --iam-instance-profile Name="<IAM-ROLE>" --instance-type <INSTANCE-TYPE> --user-data <USER-DATA>  --key-name <KEY-NAME>

.. _cloud_init:

Cloud-Init
----------

The AMI creates a basic CrateDB configuration at first launch (using
Cloud-Init). During startup the `Cloud-Init`_ process checks if ephemeral
devices are attached to the instance. If the device contains no filesystem it
will be formatted with the *ext4* file system. Otherwise the filesystem already
installed will be used. The mount point of each attached device is defined as
``/mnt/<DEV-NAME>`` where ``<DEV-NAME>`` is the name of the device as listed in
``/dev``. The configuration settings (defined in ``/etc/crate/crate.yml`` are
listed below and include:

  * Mount ephemeral devices and set the CrateDB data path on their mount points
    (:ref:`attached_devices`)
  * Enable *EC2 discovery*
  * Set node name to instance hostname

In addition to the preconfigured *Cloud-Init* setup, it is possible to inject
commands as a *User-Data* shell-script.

.. note::
   Note that *User-Data* scripts are called before the pre-installed
   *Cloud-Init* scripts and therefore the injected *User-Data* settings might
   be overridden by *Cloud-Init* (see :ref:`cloud_init`).

EC2 Discovery
-------------

The AMI uses *EC2 discovery* as a default unicast host discovery mechanism.
(see :ref:`ec2_setup`). For security reasons it is **strongly recommended** to
use `IAM roles`_ instead of providing your AWS credentials manually on your
instances (see :ref:`ec2_authentication`).

.. note::
   *EC2 discovery* is only available on CrateDB version 0.51.0 or higher.

Adapt CrateDB Configuration
---------------------------

The CrateDB configuration file ``/etc/crate/crate.yml`` can be adapted on
startup by using the *User-Data* script (see :ref:`cloud_init`). The following
example shows how to set the ``minimum_master_nodes`` and gateway configuration
setting which are essential for a `multi node setup`_. This configuration is
used when a cluster with 3 or more nodes is set up.

::

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "
    discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 2
    " >> /etc/crate/crate.yml

    echo "
    gateway:
      recover_after_nodes: 3
      recover_after_time: 5m
      expected_nodes: 3
    " >> /etc/crate/crate.yml

Launch AMI by Using the AWS CLI
-------------------------------

Instances which have the IAM role ``crate-ec2`` assigned will securely fetch
their credentials which are then used for authentication in the discovery
mechanism. The following example shows how to run a single instance of type
``m3.medium``. The adapted CrateDB configuration is passed via ``user-data.sh``
file.

::

    sh$ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-544c1923 --count 1 --iam-instance-profile Name="crate-ec2" --instance-type m3.medium --user-data $(base64 user-data.sh) --key-name my_key_pair

.. note::
   In case you want to filter machines by instance tags or security groups, add
   this configuration to the ``USER-DATA`` field parameter (see
   :ref:`filter-by-tags`).

Instance Types
==============

The instance type specifies the combination of CPU, memory, storage and
networking capacity. To receive better performance for running queries select
an instance type which gives the possibility to attach ephemeral storage. On
newer AWS instance types this storage is covered by `Solid-State-Drives`_
(short *SSD*). By choosing one of those instance types CrateDB will
automatically mount and store its data on those devices if they are attached to
the instance as a block device mapping (see also :ref:`attached_devices`).
Instance Types with additional instance store volumes (SSD or HDD) are
currently all instances of type ``m3``, ``g2``, ``r3``, ``d2`` and ``i2``.

.. _attached_devices:

Attached Devices
================

To add a block device mapping before launching an instance, it is possible to
use the ``block-device-mappings`` parameter with the ``run-instances`` command.
In this case ``ephemeral1`` will be added as an instance store volume with the
device name ``/dev/sdc``. For additional info see `device naming on linux
instances`_.

::

    sh$ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-544c1923 --count 1 --instance-type m3.medium --block-device-mappings "[{\"DeviceName\": \"/dev/sdc\",\"VirtualName\":\"ephemeral1\"}]"

.. note::
   Note that the data stored on ephemeral disks is not permanent and only
   persists during the lifetime of an instance.

If no block device mapping is configured on the EC2 instance, the default data
directory of CrateDB is set to ``/var/lib/crate``. The data paths are set in
``/etc/crate/crate.yml``.
