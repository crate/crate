====================
Full Restart Upgrade
====================

The preferred way to upgrade a running CrateDB cluster is via the
:ref:`rolling_upgrade` method. But this is not always an option (for example,
when you are upgrading from one feature version to the next).

When a :ref:`rolling_upgrade` is not possible, a full restart upgrade must be
done if you want to update CrateDB.

.. CAUTION::

   These instructions work for most ways of installing and running CrateDB.
   However, if you are using Docker, take note that ``docker service update``
   performs a :ref:`rolling_upgrade`.

   To do a full restart upgrade with Docker, you must remove the CrateDB
   service and then recreate it.

Upgrade Process
===============

.. WARNING::

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Stop Every Node
---------------

Once you have backed up your data and made the necessary preparations for
downtime, stop the ``crate`` daemon on every node in the cluster, using
whatever method is appropriate to your setup.

Upgrade Every Node
------------------

.. WARNING::

   Make sure that every ``crate`` daemon has been stopped before you continue
   or you risk data corruption or data loss.

Once the cluster has been stopped, upgrade the CrateDB software on every node
in the cluster, using whatever method is appropriate to your setup.

Start Every Node
-----------------

Once the CrateDB software on node in the cluster has been updated, start the
``crate`` daemon on every node in the cluster, using whatever method is
appropriate to your setup.
