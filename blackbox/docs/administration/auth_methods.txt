Trust Method
============

When the ``trust`` authentication method is used, the server just takes the
username provided by the client as is without further validation. This is useful
for any setup where access is controlled by other means, like network
restrictions as implemented by :ref:`administration_hba`.

Trust Authentication over Postgres Protocol
-------------------------------------------

The Postgres Protocol requires a user for every connection which is sent by
all client implementations.

Trust Authentication over HTTP
------------------------------

The HTTP implementation takes the value of the ``X-USER`` request header
as the username.

Since a user is always required for trust authentication, it is possible to
specify a default user in case that the ``X-USER`` header is not set. This is
useful to allow clients which do not provide the possibility to set any
headers, for example a web browser connecting to the Admin UI.

The default user can be specified via the ``auth.trust.http_default_user``
setting like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    auth:
      host_based:
        http_default_user: dustin
