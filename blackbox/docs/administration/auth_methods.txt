Authentication Methods
======================

.. _auth_trust:

Trust Method
============

When the ``trust`` authentication method is used, the server just takes the
username provided by the client as is without further validation. This is
useful for any setup where access is controlled by other means, like network
restrictions as implemented by :ref:`administration_hba`.

Trust Authentication Over Postgres Protocol
-------------------------------------------

The Postgres Protocol requires a user for every connection which is sent by all
client implementations.

Trust Authentication Over HTTP
------------------------------

The HTTP implementation takes the value of the ``X-USER`` request header as the
username.

Since a user is always required for trust authentication, it is possible to
specify a default user in case that the ``X-USER`` header is not set. This is
useful to allow clients which do not provide the possibility to set any
headers, for example a web browser connecting to the Admin UI.

The default user can be specified via the ``auth.trust.http_default_user``
setting like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    auth:
      trust:
        http_default_user: dustin



.. note::

   When the Enterprise Edition, and the User Management are enabled,
   the user of the Admin UI needs to be granted the following privileges:
   ``DQL`` on ``sys.shards``, ``sys.nodes``, ``sys.node_checks``,
   ``sys.checks``, ``sys.cluster``, and ``sys.jobs_log`` tables.
   As well as ``DDL`` on the ``doc`` schema.

   These ``DQL`` privileges are required by the Admin UI to display the
   cluster health, monitoring,  and checks, to list the available nodes
   in the cluster and to list the tables. The ``DDL`` privilege is
   required for the tutorial plugin.

.. _auth_cert:

Client Certificate Authentication Method
========================================

When the ``cert`` authentication method is used, the client has to connect to
CrateDB using SSL with a valid client certificate. 

If connecting via HTTP where the username is optional, the ``common name`` will
be used as username. In case a username is already provided, it has to match
the ``common name`` of the certificate. Otherwise the authentication will fail.
See :ref:`auth_trust` on how to provide a username via HTTP.

The rule that the ``common name`` must match the provided username always
applies to the postgres wire protocol, as there the username isn't optional.

Please consult the relevant client documentations for instructions on how to
connect using SSL with client certificate.
