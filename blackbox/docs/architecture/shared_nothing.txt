===========================
Clusters and Shared Nothing
===========================

The aim of this document is to describe, on a high level, how the distributed
SQL database CrateDB uses a shared nothing architecture to form
high-availability, resilient database clusters with minimal effort of
configuration. It will lay out the core concepts of the shared nothing
architecture at the heart of CrateDB. The main difference to a controller-based
architecture (e.g `master/slave architecture`_) is that every node in the
CrateDB cluster can perform every operation - hence all nodes are equal in
terms of functionality (see :ref:`shared_nothing_components`) and are
configured the same.

.. _shared_nothing_components:

Components of a CrateDB Node
============================

To understand how a CrateDB cluster works it makes sense to first take a look
at the components of an individual node of the cluster.

.. _figure_1:

.. figure:: interconnected-crate-nodes.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

   Figure 1

   Multiple interconnected instances of CrateDB form a single database cluster.
   The components of each node are equal.

:ref:`figure_1` shows that in CrateDB each node of a cluster contains the same
components that (a) interface with each other, (b) with the same component from
a different node and/or (c) with the outside world. These four major components
are: SQL Handler, Job Execution Service, Cluster State Service, and Data
Storage.

SQL Handler
-----------

The SQL Handler part of a node is responsible for three aspects:

(a) handling incoming client requests,
(b) parsing and analyzing the SQL statement from the request and
(c) creating an execution plan based on the analyzed statement
    (`abstract syntax tree`_)

The SQL Handler is the only of the four components that interfaces with the
"outside world". CrateDB supports two protocols to handle client requests:

(a) HTTP and
(b) a Binary Transport Protocol

A typical request contains a SQL statement and its corresponding arguments.

Job Execution Service
---------------------

The Job Execution Service is responsible for the execution of a plan ("job").
The phases of the job and the resulting operations are already defined in the
execution plan. A job usually consists of multiple operations that are
distributed via the Transport Protocol to the involved nodes, be it the local
node and/or one or multiple remote nodes. Jobs maintain IDs of their individual
operations. This allows CrateDB to "track" (or for example "kill") distributed
queries.

Cluster State Service
---------------------

The three main functions of the Cluster State Service are:

(a) cluster state management,
(b) election of the Metadata Primary and
(c) node discovery, thus being the main component for cluster building (as
    described in section :ref:`shared_nothing_clusters`).

It communicates using the Binary Transport Protocol.

Data Storage
------------

The data storage component handles operations to store and retrieve data from
disk based on the execution plan.

In CrateDB, the data stored in the tables is sharded, meaning that tables are
divided and (usually) stored across multiple nodes. Each shard is a separate
Lucene index that is stored physically on the filesystem. Reads and writes are
operating on a shard level.

.. _shared_nothing_clusters:

Multi Node Setup: Clusters
==========================

A CrateDB cluster is a set of two or more instances of CrateDB running on
different hosts forming a single database unit. For inter-node communication
CrateDB uses a software specific Transport Protocol that utilizes
byte-serialized Plain Old Java Objects (`POJOs`_) and operates on a separate
port. That so-called "transport port" must be open and reachable from all nodes
in the cluster.

Cluster State Management
------------------------

The cluster state is versioned and all nodes in a cluster keep a copy of the
latest cluster state. However, only a single node in the cluster - the
"Metadata Primary" - is allowed to change the state at runtime. This node is
elected by all nodes in the cluster.

Settings, Metadata, and Routing
................................

The cluster state contains all necessary meta information to maintain the
cluster and coordinate operations:

* Global cluster settings
* Discovered nodes and their status
* Schemas of tables
* The status and location of primary and replica shards

When the Primary updates the cluster state it will publish the new state to all
nodes in the cluster and and wait for all nodes to respond before processing
the next update.

.. _shared_nothing_primary_election:

Primary Election
----------------

Shared nothing architecture is often also referred to as "masterless"
architecture. For CrateDB, this is fully true in terms of data storage.
However, coordinating metadata, settings and DDL requires to have a dynamic
Metadata Primary to be elected. In a CrateDB cluster any node is eligible to be
elected as a Metadata Primary, although this could also be restricted to a
subset of nodes if required. There must be only one single Metadata Primary per
cluster.

To ensure that even in case of a network partition (when one part of the
cluster is not available) the cluster requires a quorum (relative to the
expected nodes in the cluster) to be able to elect the Metadata Primary.
Consequently the quorum must be greater than half of the expected nodes in the
cluster:

.. code-block:: mathematica

  q = n / 2 + 1

Thus if a 6 node cluster is split in half, each partition will be unable to
elect a Primary because the defined quorum of 4 nodes won't be met. This
prevents the cluster from having 2 separate Primaries which would inevitably
become out of sync and cause a "split brain" of the cluster. The desired quorum
can be set at runtime.

.. _shared_nothing_discovery:

Discovery
---------

The process of finding, adding and removing nodes is done in the discovery
module.

.. _figure_2:

.. figure:: discovery-process.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

   Figure 2

   Phases of the node discovery process. n1 and n2 already form a cluster where
   n1 is the elected Metadata Primary, n3 joins the cluster. The cluster state
   update happens in parallel!

Node discovery happens in multiple steps:

* CrateDB requires a list of potential host addresses for other CrateDB nodes
  when it is starting up. That list can either be provided by a static
  configuration or can be dynamically generated, for example by fetching DNS
  SRV records, querying the Amazon EC2 API, and so on.

* All potential host addresses are pinged. Nodes which receive the request
  respond to it with information about the cluster it belongs to, the current
  Metadata Primary, and its own node name.

* Now that the node knows the Metadata Primary, it sends a join request. The
  Primary verifies the incoming request and adds the new node to the cluster
  state that now contains the complete list of all nodes in the cluster.

* The cluster state is then published across the cluster. This guarantees the
  common knowledge of the node addition.

Networking
----------

In a CrateDB cluster all nodes have a direct link to all other nodes; this is
known as `full mesh`_ topology. Due to simplicity reasons every node maintains
a one-way connections to every other node in the network. The network topology
of a 5 node cluster looks like this:

.. _figure_3:

.. figure:: mesh-network-topology.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

   Figure 3

   Network topology of a 5 node CrateDB cluster. Each line represents a one-way
   connection.

The advantages of a fully connected network are that it provides a high degree
of reliability and the paths between nodes are the shortest possible. However,
there are limitations in the size of such networked applications because the
number of connections (c) grows quadratically with the number of nodes (n):

.. code-block:: mathematica

  c = n * (n - 1)

Cluster Behavior
================

The fact that each CrateDB node in a cluster is equal allows applications and
users to connect to any node and get the same response for the same operations.
As already described in section :ref:`shared_nothing_components` the SQL
Handler is responsible handling incoming client SQL requests, either using HTTP
or transport protocol. The "handler node" that accepts the client request also
returns the response to the client. It does neither redirect nor delegate the
request to a different nodes. The handler node parses the incoming request into
a syntax tree, analyzes it and creates an execution plan locally. Then the
operations of the plan are executed in a distributed manner. The upstream of
the final phase of the execution is always the handler which then returns the
response to the client.

Application Use Case
====================

In a conventional setup of an application using a master/slave database the
deployed stack looks similar to this:

.. _figure_4:

.. figure:: conventional-deployment.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

   Figure 4

   Conventional deployment of an application-database stack.

However, this given setup does not scale because all application servers use
the same, single entry point to the database for writes (the application can
still read from slaves) and if that entry point is unavailable the complete
stack is broken.

Choosing a shared nothing architecture allows DevOps to deploy their
applications in an "elastic" manner without SPoF. The idea is to extend the
shared nothing architecture from the database to the application which in most
cases is stateless already.

.. _figure_5:

.. figure:: shared-nothing-deployment.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

   Figure 5

   Elastic deployment making use of the shared nothing architecture.

If you deploy an instance of CrateDB together with every application server you
will be able to dynamically scale up and down your database backend depending
on your needs. The application only needs to communicate to its "bound" CrateDB
instance on localhost. The load balancer tracks the health of the hosts and if
either the application or the database on a single host fails the complete host
will taken out of the load balancing.
