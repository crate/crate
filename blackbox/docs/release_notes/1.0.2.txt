Released on 2017/01/09.

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 0.57.0 or higher
   before you upgrade to 1.0.2.

   If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
   number must be :ref:`version_1.0.0` or higher. If you want to upgrade from a
   version prior to this, the upgrade will introduce all of the breaking
   changes listed for :ref:`version_1.0.0`, and will require a `full restart
   upgrade`_.

.. WARNING::

   Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========

Changes
-------

 - Do not display current statement in ``sys.jobs`` that disabled stats.

 - It is not possible any more to circumvent ``NOT NULL`` column constraint by
   omitting the column in the ``INSERT`` statement.

 - Updated crate-admin to 1.0.3 which includes the following change:

    - Added compatibility with future CrateDB versions which will serve the
      admin-ui from ``/admin/`` instead of ``/_plugins/crate-admin/``.

Fixes
-----

 - Fixed a NPE when using a ``percentile`` aggregation in a multi-node
   environment.

 - Fixed ``INDEX`` constraint validation. Defining it on complex data types
   like e.g. ``object`` was silently ignored instead of throwing an error.

 - Fixed an issue that causes ``UnsupportedFeatureException`` for operations on
   a table where array access is used inside generated columns. e.g.::

       CREATE TABLE t1 (cola string, gencola AS (a[1]))

   Error thrown when: ``SELECT * from t1``, ``DROP TABLE t1``, etc.

 - Fixed an issue that causes hanging queries if a data node disconnects from
   the cluster.

 - CrateDB now throws a correct error if a user tries to create a table
   starting with ``_``.

 - Fixed an issue that causes ``UnhandledServerException`` on joins when
   ``WHERE`` clause contains conditions on columns of array type of both tables
   which are separated with the ``OR`` operator. e.g.::

       SELECT * FROM t1 join t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
       WHERE 'foo' = ANY(a.strArray) OR 'bar' = ANY(b.strArray)

 - Scalar functions ``longitude` and `latitude`` no longer show misleading
   results.

 - Fixed an issue that causes ``ClassCastException`` on outer joins when
   ``WHERE`` clause contains a condition that prevents null values on the
   relation that may produce nulls. e.g.::

       SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id WHERE t2.txt = 'foo'

 - Fixed NPE that occurred when an ``UPDATE`` statement inserted ``NULL`` value
   into a column that did not exist before.

 - Fixed an issue that causes an error to be thrown if nested method calls are
   used in ``HAVING`` clause. e.g.::

       having sum(power(power(id, id), id)) > 1
