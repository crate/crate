Fixes
-----

  - Fixed an issue that caused the ``cluster.name`` setting in ``crate.yml``
    file to be overridden by default name ``crate``.

  - Fixed a null pointer exception when using explicit join conditions with
    fields which were not contained in the select list. For example::

      SELECT t3.z FROM t1
      JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.b
      JOIN t3 ON t2.b = t3.c
