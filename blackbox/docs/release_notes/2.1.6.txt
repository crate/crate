=============

Released on 2017/08/29.

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB
   :ref:`version_1.1.3` or higher before you upgrade to 2.1.6.

   If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
   number must be :ref:`version_2.1.0`.  If you want to upgrade from a version
   prior to this, the upgrade will introduce all of the breaking changes listed
   for :ref:`version_2.1.0`, and will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

   Consult the :ref:`version_2.1.0_upgrade_notes` for ``2.1.0`` when upgrading.

Changelog

Fixes
-----

 - Fixed issue that caused the Monitoring tab to redirect to ``/401`` when
   the user didn't have privileges for ``sys.cluster`` or ``sys.jobs_log``.

 - Fix issue where a ``DROP TABLE`` statement would return before the table
   privileges are dropped.

 - Fixed a bug which returned a malformed response for PSQL queries containing
   whitespace characters.

 - Fixed a bug in the detection of correlated subqueries which are currently
   unsupported.

 - Fix display of redundant parenthesis around expressions visible in
   ``SHOW CREATE`` and ``EXPLAIN`` statements.

 - Updated Crash to ``0.21.5`` which removes a deprecation warning logged in
   CrateDB server on every REST request.

 - Fixed an issue that caused ``path.logs`` setting in ``crate.yml`` to be
   ignored.

 - Fixed column name in output by removing new lines when select list contains
   subquery. E.g.::

     SELECT 1 =
         (SELECT 1)

 - Fixed an issue that prevents CrateDB from bootstrap on Windows hosts.

 - Fixed an issue that caused queries with ``IS NULL`` or ``IS NOT NULL`` on
   columns of type ``geo_point`` to fail.

 - Changed ``crate`` unix/linux startup script to use standard ``sh`` syntax
   instead of ``bash`` specific syntax.
