Changelog

Fixes
-----

 - Fix issue where a ``DROP TABLE`` statement would return before the table
   privileges are dropped.

 - Fixed a bug which returned a malformed response for PSQL queries containing
   whitespace characters.

 - Fixed a bug in the detection of correlated subqueries which are currently
   unsupported.

   ``SHOW CREATE`` and ``EXPLAIN`` statements.

         (SELECT 1)

 - Fixed an issue that caused queries with ``IS NULL`` or ``IS NOT NULL`` on
