Changes
=======

 - Improved error handling when using ``LIMIT``/``OFFSET`` that exceed
   ``Integer`` range.

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed issue which prevents blob directories from being removed after a
   ``drop blob table`` command when a custom blob location is configured.

 - Fixed an issue that caused conditions like ``not x = any( )`` to not
   find empty lists when used in WHERE clauses.

 - Fixed a race condition in an unsorted right outer join with one empty table
   that could lead to incorrect results.

 - Division by aggregation that resulted in 0. e.g.
   ``SELECT max(long_col) / min(long_col) from t)`` now correctly returns
   ``ArtithmeticException`` and does not hang.

 - Fixed a race condition in ``KILL`` statements which lead to a memory leak.

 - Fixed an issue that prevent a node from starting on Windows if the
   sigar-plugin is removed.
