Version 0.52.0
==============

Released on 2015/10/13.

Changelog
=========

 - The client will now accept IPv6 literals as server addresses.

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.15.0 which includes following changes:

   - Display cluster checks on overview page.

   - Display relative Crate process CPU usage as bar chart and show number of
     cores per node.

 - Allow quoted subscript expressions in SQL statement. This will allow
   supporting various client applications on Windows that use ODBC.

 - Added ``try_cast`` scalar function.

 - Added cluster checks which are exposed via the ``sys.checks`` table.

 - Added ``os_info`` column to ``sys.nodes`` table. Currently the column only
   lists the number of available processors in the JVM (which is usually equal
   to the number of cores of the CPU).

 - Upgraded Elasticsearch to 1.7.2. This update changes the default value for
   delayed allocation of `unassigned shards`_. Also updated the upstream of EC2
   discovery module.
