Version 0.52.1
==============

Released on 2015/11/04.

Changelog
=========

 - Fixed an issue that caused orphaned partitions with an remaining alias to
   not be recognized correctly.

 - Fix: clean up file descriptors in case of exceptions when retrieving blobs
   over the REST API.

 - Fixed an issue that was causing like queries to fail if using a special regex
   character.

 - Upgraded Elasticsearch to 1.7.3.

 - Fixed the issue which causes overloading of the first configured node in the
   cluster when multiple clients connections are established.

 - Fixed a possible race condition that could lead to queries getting stuck
   (Only affected SELECT queries with a limit/offset > 500000).

 - Fix: Crate won't start properly if a plugin loading error occurs
   (e.g. through a misconfigured plugin).

 - Fixed an issue that was introduced in 0.52.0 which could cause a FetchContext
   to remain open longer than necessary in an error case. This could then lead
   to failures if an attempt was made to move shards to which the FetchContext
   hold onto.

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.15.2 which includes following changes:

   - Fixed a bug that displays partitions that are not related to the selected
     table in the table-list.

   - Fixed a bug where cluster shows wrong state if the number of nodes gets
     smaller than the minimum master nodes.

   - Fixed a bug that displays a zero value as NULL value.

   - Fixed URL to download in dropdown that notifies about old Crate version.

   - Fixed a visual bug that let an item in the node/table list partly disappear
     if scrolling gets enabled.

 - Updated crash to version 0.14.1 which contains the following changes:

   - Floating point values are no longer rounded to 6 places under python2.7 if
     output using the tabular or mixed output format. Now the behaviour for all
     output formats is the same and consistent with the Python3 output format.

     Python 2.6 will still display rounded values.

   - Fixed the issue casuing parsing error while using internal ``non-sql``
     crash commands with semicolon.
