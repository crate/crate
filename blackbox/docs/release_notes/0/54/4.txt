Version 0.54.4
==============

Released on 2016/01/22.

Changelog
=========

 - Job prepare phases now run on their own threads in order to prevent deadlocks
   in netty event loop.

 - Improved reliability of queries on system tables even if cluster is
   overloaded and/or doc table queries are stuck.

 - Fewer retries are done when a shard is not fully recovered and
   queried in order to safe threads.

 - Fix: The recovery expected nodes check incorrectly included client nodes
   instead of just data and master nodes.
