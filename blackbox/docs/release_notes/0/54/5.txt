Version 0.54.5
==============

Released on 2016/02/15.

Changelog
=========

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.17.1 which contains following changes:

   - Fix: updated BlenderPro webfont. This fixes CSS glitches in Firefox 44
     which misinterpreted height of webfont.

   - Fix: The recent update of the shard calculation for relocating shards
     caused problems with partitioned tables showing incorrect table health.

   - Fix: Reading an undefined property while cluster is offline caused
     Javascript error.

   - Fix: Rename cluster check indicator on statusbar to ``Checks``.

   - Improved display of recovery percentage in table view.

   - Fix: relocating shards where previously displayed as "underreplicated"
     shards causing a yellow cluster state while relocating was in progress.

   - Fix: change in calculation of recovery percentage broke calculations for
     partitioned tables causing table partitions not showing up.

   - Fix: now also include unassigned shards (as 0% recovered) in calculation of
     recovery percentage which is displayed per table. Previously it could show
     "100% recovery done" even if there were still unassigned shards.

 - Updated crash to 0.16.0 which contains following changes:

    - The order of the keys/columns of the ``json`` output format is now
      deterministic and reflects the order of the columns in the executed query.

    - ``Ctrl-c`` no longer results in a KeyboardInterrupt exception if invoked
      while a query is being executed.

    - Added initial auto-completion support for the internal ``\format`` and
      ``\r`` commands.

    - Added a new ``\r`` command which can be used to read and execute
      statements from a file.

    - Fixed an error that occurred under Python 3 if one of the built-in
      commands that require an argument were called without argument.

 - Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` that occured if ``= ANY ()`` was used with a
   literal array containing null values.

 - Fixed an issue that caused array-literals with null items to result in an
   error.

 - Added ``routing_state`` column to ``sys.shards`` table in order to fix the
   underreplicated shards calculation in admin ui

 - Fix: exporting a table with a generated partitioned column using ``copy to``
   caused an Exception.
