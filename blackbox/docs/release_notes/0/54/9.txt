Released on 2016/05/12.

Changelog
=========

 - Improved retry logic of bulk inserts/updates in order to prevent stack
   overflows caused by recursive retry calls that could lead to hanging updates
   and imports using ``copy from``.

 - Fixed a race condition that could lead to relative write operations (``x = x
   + 1``) to be executed twice.

 - In certain cases settings provided via ``-Des.`` system properties could
   be overridden by the ``crate.yml`` provided in ``$CRATE_HOME/config``.

 - Fixed an issue that prevented generated columns to work correctly
   with arrays.

 - Restrict creation of tables having the primary key constraint within
   an array column type or its children.
   with arrays.

 - Fixed an issue that could lead to the ``internal_action_long_timeout`` and
   ``recovery_activity_timeout`` settings to be reset to a wrong default value
   on a setting update.

 - Fixed an issue that could lead to stuck queries if a node dropped out of the
   cluster.

 - Fix: Changing the column policy on a partitioned table throws an
   exception if more than one partition exists.

 - Fix: Altering a setting on an empty partitioned table is changing
   the setting on all exising tables.

 - Fix: Throw proper error if a column is used twice in primary key constraint.

 - Fix: Improved error handling to make sure ``JOIN`` queries don't get stuck on
   shard failures.

 - Fix bug which could cause the ``MATCH`` predicate in ``WHERE`` clause for
   partitioned tables to fail. This happens in cases when a column ident of the
   ``MATCH`` predicate is not a primary key column.

 - Fix: While restoring a snapshot with multiple indices inside, selecting
   concrete indices can result in a wrong index being restored.

 - Fix: Insert by query into a table with nested primary keys or
   nested partitioned by columns defined did not work.
