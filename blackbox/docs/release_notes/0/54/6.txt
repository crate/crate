Version 0.54.6
==============

Released on 2016/02/25.

Changelog
=========

 - Fixed a NPE that occurred if a table was created using the ES API with a
   mapping that uses ``copy_to`` but does not define ``_meta.indices``.

 - Fixed a NPE that could occur if a system table was joined with a regular
   user table.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause queries with ``ORDER BY`` on partitioned
   tables to get stuck if multiple shards were on the same node and a single
   shard couldn't produce the whole result.
