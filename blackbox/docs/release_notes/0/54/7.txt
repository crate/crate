Released on 2016/03/11.

Changelog
=========

 - Clarified error messages on unsupported join operations.

 - Removed timestamp type guessing within objects and within the ``PARTITION``
   clause of the ``RESTORE SNAPSHOT`` statement.

 - Made equality operator for ``object`` types work correctly for different
   inner numeric values.

 - Fix: Querying system tables could fail if connected to a client
   node and cluster contains another client node.

 - Upgraded the included groovy dependency from 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 for security
   fixes.

 - Conversion from (double) arrays to geo_point is now more lenient and allows
   integer values inside the array. This was done since some encoders tend to
   convert float/double values to integers.
