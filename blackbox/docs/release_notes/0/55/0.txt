Version 0.55.0
==============

Released on 2016/05/30.

Changelog
=========

 - BREAKING: Units are now required for time or byte based settings in the
   ``crate.yml`` configuration file. Nodes won't start otherwise.

 - BREAKING: The ``gateway.local.sync`` setting has been renamed to
   ``translog.sync_interval``.

 - BREAKING: It is no longer possible to specify the location of the config
   file with the ``CONF_FILE`` environment variable, or the ``-Des.config``,
   ``-Des.default.config``, or ``-Delasticsearch.config`` parameters. The
   config file must now be named ``crate.yml`` and must be located in the
   default ``config/`` directory, in the directory specified in the
   ``CONF_DIR`` environmental variable, or the one specified in the
   ``-Des.path.home`` parameter.

 - BREAKING: Crate will die now on all plugin loading errors.

 - BREAKING: Column names may not contain the ``.`` character anymore.

 - BREAKING: Tables are not refreshed automatically anymore before and after
   a ``DELETE-BY-QUERY`` operation is applied.

 - Upgraded Elasticsearch to 2.3.3.

 - Implemented trigonometric scalar functions (``sin()``, ``cos()``, ``tan()``,
   ``asin()``, ``acos()``, and ``atan())``.

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.18.0 which contains following changes:

    - Cluster check include now clickable links.

    - Load additional links in menu dynamically from news feed.

    - Fixed an issue which caused rendering errors in the node list if the
      cluster contains multiple nodes with the same name note: changes the url
      to the detail view of single nodes.

    - Added UTM tokens to links that link to the Crate.IO blog.

    - Updated news feed URL.

    - Label the master node in the cluster node list.

 - Fixed a bug which prevented complete deletion of tables in custom
   schemas.

 - Improved the ``KILL`` behaviour for ``COPY``, ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE``
   statements.

 - Fixed a ``ClassCastException`` that occurred if the left side of a ``IN``
   predicate was a function.

 - Added links to Cluster check documentation.

 - Removed the ``creationTime`` property from ``SQL(Bulk)Request`` and changed
   the `duration` property on ``SQL(Bulk)Response`` to return the server-side
   duration instead of the full round-trip duration.

 - The default number of shards is calculated dynamically upon the table
   creation.

 - Deprecated camelCase names on ``CREATE ANALYZER``.

 - ``+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`` is no longer set by default. It can still be
   set using the ``JAVA_OPTS`` environment variable.

 - Made sure orphaned contexts are cleaned up eventually after a coordinator
   node dies.

 - Load ``crate.yml`` explicitly and do not allow any other extension than
   ``yml`` for the configuration file.

 - Restrict creation of tables having the primary key constraint within an
   array column type or its children.

 - Renamed all scalar function names to lowercase (CamelCase names were
   transformed to lowercase using ``_`` as word boundary)

 - Fixed a NPE at the ``substr`` scalar function when using column references as
   from/to arguments containing null values.

 - NOTE: Upgrading to this Crate version is only supported from >= 0.52.

 - Removed the ``bulk.partition_creation_timeout`` setting.

 - Removed internal migration code that ensured schema backward compatibility
   to Crate versions <= 0.45

 - Improved the speed of global aggregation queries which involve more than 1
   shard per node.

 - The log level of loggers can now be set at runtime via the ``SET`` statement.

 - Improved validation of geo point data type; now it is not possible any more
   to insert invalid latitude or longitude in array literals.

 - Nodes can be configured now to allow only SQL statements resulting
   in read operations using new setting ``node.sql.read_only``.

 - Improved bulk insert/update and copy-from performance when replicas
   are configured.

 - Fixed planner issues that could cause INSERT INTO with a JOIN in the
   sub-query to fail or get stuck.

 - Removed the ``jobs.keep_alive_timeout`` setting and all related logic.
   This means it is no longer possible to enable automatic job termination.

 - Added a ``node_filters`` option to ``COPY FROM``.

 - Add support for ``COPY FROM`` to ``EXPLAIN``.

 - The ``COPY FROM`` statement now also accepts an array of strings as URI.

 - Added support for schemes supported by the used JVM's ``URL`` implementation
   for ``COPY FROM``. These usually include``http``, ``https``, ``ftp`` and
   ``jar``.

 - Added support for the ``unnest`` table function.

 - Implemented cluster check for installed java version.

 - removed wrong behaving CrateClient feature which allowed to load client
   settings from a configuration file.

 - Crate will now recognize settings defined by crate plugins.

 - Implemented the EXPLAIN command for SELECT statements.

 - Removed the limitation that the WHERE clause couldn't contain certain
   expressions in `DELETE` statements

 - Exposed setting the default schema via HTTP header.

 - Added ``lower`` and ``upper`` string functions.
