Released on 2016/07/07.

Changelog
=========

 - Fix: selecting ``os['timestamp']`` multiple times in same ``sys.nodes``
   statement could result in different values.

 - Fix: selecting ``os``, ``network``, ``fs`` or ``process`` from ``sys.nodes``
   in very quick succession or multiple times in same select statement could
   lead to wrong results for percentual values from the underlying sigar
   library.

 - Fixed performance issues with arithmetic operators and functions.

 - Fixed duplicate key error handling for multiple row inserts. Instead of
   responding with an error the number of affected row is adjusted.

 - Fixed a NPE that occurred when inserting null values to a generated column.
