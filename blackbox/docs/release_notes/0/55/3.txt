Version 0.55.3
==============

Released on 2016/08/05.

Changelog
=========

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause select statements to get stuck.

 - Fixed an issue which prevents java client from running explain statements.

 - Fixed an issue which caused ``current_timestamp`` as part of a generated
   expression to not work correctly. This fix will only affect new tables.
   Tables which already contain a generated column which uses
   ``current_timestamp`` will need to be recreated.

 - Improved error handling when grouping by invalid data types.

 - Fixed an issue when ordering by a function on a joined query.

 - Fixed an issue which could lead to wrong Error messages due to a race
   condition.

 - Fix: Arrays of geo_point can be used in insert/update statements as literals
   as well as bind arguments.

 - Fixed a read isolation issue which could cause joins involving system and
   blob tables to return inconsistent results.

 - On Hunspell dictionary configuration, the parameter
   ``indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.location`` has been removed and
   ``<path.conf>/hunspell`` is always used.

 - Fixed a bug that prevented join and sort on blob tables.

 - Adapted behaviour of ``stats.enabled``, ``stats.jobs_log_size`` and
   ``stats.operations_log_size`` settings to match behaviour of other cluster
   wide settings, e.g. ``minimum_master_nodes``.

 - Fix: Do not fetch table stats when node is not fully available yet. This
   could have led to ``NullPointerExceptions`` during long recovery process on
   node start.

 - Fixed an issue which prevented running join queries on empty partitioned
   tables.

 - Fix: the ``hostname`` column of the ``sys.nodes`` table returns a hostname
   instead of an IP address.

 - Fixed an issue that caused select statements to get stuck if used as part of
   a bulk request. Now a proper error is raised.

 - Updated Elasticsearch to 2.3.4.

 - Fix: the ``within`` scalar function now allows querying geo_shapes within
   geo_shapes.
