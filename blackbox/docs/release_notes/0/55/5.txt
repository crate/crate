==============

Released on 2016/09/19.

Changelog
=========

 - Fix: Dropping a partition while inserting by primary key into same
   partition should not raise an exception but returns a 0 row count instead.

 - Fixed: JAR conflict if HDFS plugin with Hadoop 2.x is used.

 - Fix: it is now also possible to restore a snapshot of a single partition of a
   partitioned table in a non-existent table. This requires that the snapshot
   has been created with version ``0.55.5`` or greater!

 - Fixed: join conditions were not properly validated and an expression with a
   not yet defined relation could be used.

 - Fixed: setting of a default schema was not possible by using the HTTP REST
   endpoint.

 - Fixed: an error was thrown in case of primary key bulk delete statement with
   null bulk arguments.

 - Fix: return 0 rows instead of an error when executing select queries that
   try to match null for primary key columns. e.g.::

     select * from t where pk in (null);

 - Fix: allow select statements on columns of multiple nested object array.

 - Fix: do not allow to create tables in read-only system schemas.

 - Fix: ``COPY FROM`` statements fail if null values are inserted into
   partitioned tables.

 - Fix: type was not set correctly when creating a token filter with default
   name and no type.

 - Fix: prevent creating ``char filters`` with missing properties.
