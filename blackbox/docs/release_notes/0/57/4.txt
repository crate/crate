Version 0.57.4
==============

Released on 2016/11/30.

Changelog
=========

 - Fixed ``ClassCastException`` that occurs when executing queries with ``order
   by`` that uses scalar functions which have integer return type and null
   values are involved in the ordering. e.g.::

     SELECT * from t1 ORDER BY abs(col1)

   Here, col1 contains nulls.

 - Fixed NPE that that can occur in join queries when left table has no
   matching records.

 - Fixed issue that caused join queries to get stuck when killed.

 - Improved error message when column is missing from ``group by``. The column
   alias is used instead of the column name.

 - Improve error message for not supported set operations ``intersect`` and
   ``except``.

 - Improved error handling: Sometimes a user would get a ``Job Killed`` error
   instead of the actual error that caused a query to get interrupted.

 - Fixed a memory leak that was caused by blob uploads.
