==============

Released on 2016/11/22.

Changelog
=========

 - Fixed NPE that can occur on invalid HTTP requests.

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.21.3 which includes the following change:

    - Fixed bug that caused the cluster REST URL link in nodes view page to be
      unsafe.

 - Updated Crash to 0.19.1 which includes the following change:

    - ``--sysinfo`` does not fail any more when the name of the connected
      CrateDB node contains a unicode character.

    - Crash was trying to connect to invalid hosts if no hosts were provided
      via ``--hosts`` argument and configuration file was already present.

 - Fixed an issue at the ``date_trunc`` scalar evaluation that caused an error
   to be thrown if the given ``interval`` is a reference and evaluates to
   ``NULL``.

 - Fixed an issue in the runtime error handling that could cause
   right-outer-join queries to get stuck.

 - Changed ``<literal> = ANY([null])`` to no longer result in a cast exception
   but return null.

 - Fixed the ``IN`` and ``ANY`` predicates to return null if any of the
   arguments are null and there is no match.

 - Fixed a race condition that could cause join statements or statements with a
   very high limit to get stuck or result in a "Same bucket of a page set more
   than once" error.

 - ``COPY FROM`` now correctly resolves files within symlinked folders when a
   wildcard is used in the path.

 - Fixed an issue that caused join query to get stuck when an expression
   evaluation related to both relations caused an error.

 - Fixed ``ORDER BY`` clauses on scalar subqueries: In certain cases the
   ``ORDER BY`` clause got removed resulting in an un-ordered result.

 - Fixed inconsistency in the calculation of low/high disk watermark
   thresholds for node checks and logs.

 - Fixed an issue with certain subselects which led to incorrect results.
   (e.g.: ``select sum(x) from (select x from t limit 1)``)

 - Fixed an issue which prevented inserting data using the ``COPY FROM``
   statement into tables created with the ``CLUSTERED BY`` clause.

 - Fixed null value handling of comparison operator ``BETWEEN``.

 - Fixes evaluation of ``OR`` expressions if one argument evaluates to ``true``
   and the other results in an error.

 - Fix: Prevent adding columns with restricted names to dynamic objects

 - Reduced the memory requirement for update and delete statements which only
   affect a small subset of a table

 - Fixed an issue that caused the ``WHERE`` clause of queries on ``unnest(..)``
   to be ignored.
