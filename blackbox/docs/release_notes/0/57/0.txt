Changelog
=========

 - Updated Crash to 0.19.0 which includes the following change:

    - Allow "short hosts" as Crate hosts argument, such as ``:4200`` for
      ``localhost:4200``

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.21.0 which includes following changes:

    - Added a button to clear the search field in the table list view.

    - Added Spanish translation.

 - Allow ``admin-ui`` to be served from ``/`` if accessed via browser.
   Otherwise the request is handled by the REST API.

 - Upgraded Elasticsearch to 2.4.1

 - Improved parameter de-serialization of the ``Bind`` message. If a client
   doesn't provide parameter types in the parse message, bind will now default
   to ``text/varchar`` instead of ``text/json``. This enables support for
   clients like pg-nodejs.

 - Added support for the ``Flush`` message in the Postgres wire protocol.

 - Added support for scalar subquery expressions to ``SELECT`` statements.

 - Added ``CURRENT_SCHEMA`` system information function

 - Added column ``table_schema`` in ``information_schema.columns``,
   ``information_schema.tables`` and ``information_schema.table_constraints``
   in order to be conform with the SQL standard. The column ``schema_name`` is
   deprecated.

 - Added support for ``BETWEEN``.

 - Added support of expressions in the array constructors. Allowed to to write
   an array constructor in the PostgreSQL form, like ``ARRAY[]``.

 - Expose bound psql port in ``sys.nodes``

 - BREAKING: Removed deprecated Plugin interface methods.

 - Deprecated the ``CrateClient`` class. You should start using the PostgreSQL
   JDBC driver instead.

 - Extended the Postgres wire protocol to support describe for queries with
   result sets. This removes the requirement to set ``prepareThreshold=0``
   when using the JDBC client.

 - Added support for ``SET LOCAL|SESSION`` statements.

 - Support ``SELECT`` queries without the ``FROM`` clause. Such queries are
   executed against the ``sys.cluster`` table.

 - The PostgreSQL wire protocol is enabled by default.
