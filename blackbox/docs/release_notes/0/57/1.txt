Released on 2016/11/10.

Changelog
=========

 - Fixed NPE in the ``percentile`` aggregation fucntion. The NPE was occurring
   in case when queried shards have no records.

 - Fixed an issue with select queries returning duplicate outputs when
   ``where`` uses ``=`` with ``primary key`` and an order by which is also part
   of the selected fields is used.

 - Fixed adding a column to an existing object array using ``ALTER TABLE``.

 - Fix: selecting ``os_info['jvm']['vm_vendor']`` and
   ``os_info['jvm']['name']`` caused ``ColumnUnknownException``.

 - Removed reduced thread stack size java option, stack size defaults to JVM
   defaults now.

 - Fixed an issue that causes outer joins to fail with an exception if columns
   are referenced in a where clause but not as select items.

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.21.2 which includes the following change:

     - fixed incorrect sql query for creating the tweets table in the tutorial.

 - Fixed an issue that caused right outer joins to get stuck instead of
   returning a result if the left table is empty.

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.21.1 which includes the following changes:

     - Fix: Corrected the sql queries to display the table list in the Tables
       view, and to create the tweets table only if it does not exist.

 - Fixed an issue that caused left outer joins to return an empty result if the
   joined table is empty.

 - Fix: Certain subselects with nested ``order by`` and ``limit`` or ``offset``
   produced incorrect results. e.g.::

     select * from (select a, b from t1 order by a limit 3) as t
     order by b limit 2
