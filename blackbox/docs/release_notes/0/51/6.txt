Changelog
=========

 - Fix check if setting is settable/resettable on runtime for nested settings.

 - Exposed missing cluster gateway settings.

 - Throw an exception when someone attempts to change non-runtime changeable
   settings.

 - Fixed a race condition that could cause ``COPY FROM`` operations to get stuck
   if shards were to be relocated.

 - Fixed a race condition that could cause the re-creation of an already
   existing table partition and therefore potential dataloss when creating
   a lot of partitions simultaniously using ``COPY FROM`` or bulk inserts.
