Changelog
=========

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.14.1 which includes following changes:

   - Fix: number of underreplicated shards were fetched and displayed
     incorrectly.

   - Load ``plugins.json`` that can inject additional modules on app start
     the "Get Started" tutorial is now implemented as a plugin.

   - Fix: approximate number of underreplicated and missing records per table
     was calculated incorrectly, which could have lead to different results when
     viewing table info on admin ui of different nodes.

   - Fix: automatically refresh load history chart on overview page.

 - Fixed a bug which prevented a retry, or caused a retry to fail if a shard
   was closed because of relocation.

 - Fixed an issue which could cause an error if a ``group by`` query was killed.

 - Added a limitation notice that ``COPY TO`` doesn't work with system tables
   and attempting to do so will result in a more meaningful error.

 - Fixed bulk delete for partitioned tables where partition column was part
   of the where clause.

 - Fixed an issue that could lead to unclosed contexts when issuing bulk
   requests.
