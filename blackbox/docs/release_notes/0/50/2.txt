Version 0.50.2
==============

Released on 2015/07/29.

Changelog
=========

  - Fix: reduced the amount of unnecessary data handled on select queries.

  - Fixed an issue which prevented column updates to be noticed in the cluster
    on tables in custom schemas.

  - Fix: issuing ``KILL ALL`` when a ``SELECT`` statement hung due to a node
    becoming unavailable during execution could result in error response.

  - Improved the error handling: In case threadpools are exhausted (due to very
    high load on the cluster) queries could get stuck instead of being aborted
    right away.

  - Fixed a bug where a job entry wasn't cleaned up on any parser/analyzer
    errors.

  - Fixed an issue that caused queries on blob tables to cause a
    ``NullPointerException`` if the filter in the ``WHERE CLAUSE`` resulted in a
    ``null`` value.

  - Fix: fixed an issue which caused an error if one selects a setting
    which is not set.

  - Fix: fixed an issue which caused ``TypeConversion`` errors if a setting was
    selected which represents a byte size (e.g.
    ``indices['store']['throttle']['my_bytes_per_sec']``)

  - Fixed a rare bug which could cause a ``MapperParsingException`` if one
    creates a new dynamic array concurrently.
