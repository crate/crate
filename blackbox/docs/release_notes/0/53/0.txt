Released on 2015/11/16.

Changelog
=========

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.16.0 which includes following changes:

   - The table list is now fully searchable and sorted by table name within
     its schemas.

   - Fix: charts are not correctly displayed in Microsoft Edge browser.

   - UDC: identify anonymous user with cluster id. Both user ID and cluster ID
     are anonymous traits. Note: You can disable UDC via the ``udc.enabled``
     setting on the Crate server.

 - Implement ``intersects`` scalar function.

 - Fix: properly restrict partitioned by columns to primitive types during
   analysis.

 - Added functionality to index and match geo shapes.

 - Restrict ``WITHIN`` function to only accept geo_point (and compatible types)
   as first argument.

 - Added snapshot and restore functionality.

 - Changed crate launch scripts to no longer support extending the
   ``CRATE_CLASSPATH`` environment variable.

 - Added initial limited cross and inner join support.

 - Updated crate/elasticsearch for improved logging on graceful shutdown errors.

 - Added ``array_cat``, ``array_unique`` and ``array_difference`` scalar
   functions. Also modified ``concat`` function to resolve to ``array_cat`` when
   ``concat`` function is called with 2 array args, so the operator ``||`` will
   work with arrays.
