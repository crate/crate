Version 0.56.2
==============

Released on 2016/10/13.

Changelog
=========

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.20.2 which includes following changes:

   - Fixed the chart error that occured when navigating between the overview
     and other pages.

   - Fixed the logo URL which was not redirecting correctly.

   - Fixed an issue that caused the query history in the console view to be
     inconsistent.

 - Changed the server_version formatting sent via the postgres wire protocol to
   be compatible with clients which can't handle the numeric notation.

 - Updated Crash to 0.18.1 which contains the following change:

    - Fix: crashed in verbose mode if Crate didn't provide an error trace.

 - Postgres clients do not accept negative years in timestamp string but
   require ``BC`` suffix for dates *before Christ*. Now the correct date format
   string is sent to client.

 - Removed arbitrary limit on timestamp values. Now also dates before
   1653-02-10 and after 2286-11-20 are supported. However, there is still a
   limitation that the year needs to be within in the integer range (-292275054
   <= year <= 292278993).
