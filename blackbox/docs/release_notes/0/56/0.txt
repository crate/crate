Version 0.56.0
==============

Released on 2016/09/23.

Changelog
=========

 - BREAKING: Column names returned on queries does not include the table and
   schema names anymore, i.e., ``select doc.t1.a from t1`` will return column
   name ``a`` instead of ``doc.t1.a``.

 - BREAKING: Moved some ``sys.checks`` into a new ``sys.node_checks`` table as
   those checks were actually node specific. Added the ability to acknowledge
   failing checks on this new ``sys.node_checks`` table.

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.20.0 which contains following changes:

    - Added a new console option to allow users to display the error trace when
      an error occurs.

    - Added translation for tutorial plugin. This enables support for i18n for
      any admin ui plugin.

 - Fix: aggregations on no-match ``JOIN`` queries incorrectly returned empty
   result Now these queries fail because aggregations are not supported on
   joins.

 - Updated crash to 0.18.0 which contains following changes:

    - Don't show tables from ``pg_catalog`` if ``\dt`` command is used.

    - Make the ``\check`` command to display both, node and cluster checks.
      Allow ``node`` and ``cluster`` arguments for the command to display node
      and cluster checks, respectively.

 - Added support for outer joins: ``LEFT``, ``RIGHT``, and ``FULL``.

 - Added ``percentile`` aggregate function.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause joins on 3+ tables to produce the wrong
   result.

 - Fix: inserting in tables which have a generated column with
   ``current_timestamp`` failed.

 - Added the ``sys.summits`` table. The table contains the information about
   mountains in the Alps higher than 2000 meters, which are used as node names.

 - Replaced the existing list of random node names with the list of mountains
   in the Alps.

 - Remove limitation that prevented usage of columns from multiple tables
   in the same order by expression. e.g.::

     FROM t1, t2, t3 ORDER BY t1.x - t2.y + t3.z

 - F501: Added SQL conformance info to ``information_schema.sql_features``.

 - Updated crate-admin to 0.19.0 which contains following changes:

   - Display failing node checks on overview page and allow to dismiss them.

   - Added German translation. his change also enables the possibility for
     further i18n.

 - Added plugin for unicast host discovery on Azure (ARM mode)

 - Optimized ``sys.nodes`` queries.

 - Queries on the ``sys.nodes`` table will now short circuit in case some nodes
   in the cluster are unresponsive. All columns of the unresponsive nodes will
   contain null values except ``id`` and ``name``.

 - Added support for subselect statements that can be rewritten as a single
   query.

 - Fetch operations are now threaded per shard instead of per node.

 - Added initial experimental support for the postgres wire protocol. This is
   disabled by default.

 - Improved the error message of ``COPY FROM`` statements which fail due to
   invalid entries in the files being imported.

 - Implemented basic conditional functions (``coalesce()``, ``greatest()``,
   ``least()``, ``nullif()``).

 - Implemented ``NOT NULL`` column constraint.

 - Added high/low disk watermark node checks exposed via ``sys.node_checks``.

 - Leverage new Lucene queries for geo point queries (``distance``, ``within``,
   ``match`` using ``within``). Newly created tables with geo_point columns
   automatically use the new queries whereas previously created tables still
   use the backwards compatible old queries.

 - Implemented ``OPTIMIZE`` table statement which optimizes tables and
   partitions by merging the segments of which each table and partition
   consists.

 - Updated crash to 0.17.0 which contains following changes:

      - Added support for ``OPTIMIZE`` table statement.

      - All statements will respond with an affected rows count now.

      - Added a configuration file that stores default values for Crash. The
        file is placed inside the user's application config folder. A path to a
        custom configuration file can be specified using the ``--config``
        command line argument.

      - Dropped Python 2.6 support.

      - Added support for client certificates.

      - It is now possible to disable autocompletion using
        ``--no-autocomplete`` command line argument and to toggle autocomplete
        using the ``\autocomplete`` crash command.

      - Fixed "read file" command (``\r``) for legacy Python 2.7.

      - Fixed result info command output for whitespace other than space
        characters in queries.

      - Fixed call of ``sysinfo`` command when launching the shell.

 - Deprecated usage of COPY TO without specifying a DIRECTORY. This will
   prevent a user from defining an output path that conflicts with multiple
   shards.

 - Optimize count aggregations by using custom data type to avoid boxing of
   primitives into Objects.
