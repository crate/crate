Released on 2017/03/27.

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 0.57.0 or higher
   before you upgrade to 1.1.1.

   this version will require a full cluster restart.

Changes
=======

 - Querying the admin UI from ``/_plugin/crate-admin/`` will now
   redirect to ``/``.

 - Added possible data type conversion to a timestamp array.
   e.g. ``cast(['2017-01-01','2017-12-31'] as array(timestamp))``

 - Improved error handling when using ``LIMIT``/``OFFSET`` that exceed Integer
   range.

 - Updated crate-admin to 1.2.2, which includes the following changes:

   - Fixed issue where arrays in formatted objects were not displayed.

   - Removed blog feed from side bar.

   - Increased base font size.

   - Fixed issue that caused tables to display a healthy status even though
     their partitions were in critical state

   - Added fallback to unformatted results if no column types are returned.

   - Display notification warning only when a new CrateDB version is released.

   - Added ``lineWrapping`` option to console Editor.

   - Fixed issue that cause the console text to appear on top of the settings
     tab.

   - Fixed load reading display when the readings were invalid (for example, on
     Windows).

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed a regression introduced in 1.1.1 which could cause
   queries to return wrong values.

 - Fixed bug introduced in 1.1.0 which caused all partitioned tables to
   become unusable.

 - Fixed an issued that caused conditions like ``not x = any( )`` to not
   find empty lists when used in ``WHERE`` clauses.

 - Fixed a regression introduced in 1.1.0 that caused statements like
   ``COPY TO '/invalid/directory/'`` to get stuck instead of resulting in an
   error.
