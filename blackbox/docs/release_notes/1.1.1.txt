Changes

   redirect to ``/``.

 - Improved error handling when using ``LIMIT``/``OFFSET`` that exceed Integer
   range.

 - Updated crate-admin to 1.2.2, which includes the following changes:

   - Fixed issue where arrays in formatted objects were not displayed.

   - Removed blog feed from side bar.

   - Increased base font size.

   - Fixed issue that caused tables to display a healthy status even though
     their partitions were in critical state

   - Added fallback to unformatted results if no column types are returned.

   - Display notification warning only when a new CrateDB version is released.

   - Added ``lineWrapping`` option to console Editor.

   - Fixed issue that cause the console text to appear on top of the settings

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed a regression introduced in 1.1.1 which could cause
   queries to return wrong values.

   become unusable.

 - Fixed an issued that caused conditions like ``not x = any( )`` to not
   find empty lists when used in ``WHERE`` clauses.

   ``COPY TO '/invalid/directory/'`` to get stuck instead of resulting in an
   error.
