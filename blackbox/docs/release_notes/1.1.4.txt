   number must be :ref:`version_1.1.1` or higher. If you want to upgrade from a
   version prior to this, the upgrade will introduce all of the breaking

Changelog
=========

Changes
-------

 - Improved the resiliency of the retrieval of large results via HTTP. Queries
   are now aborted and result in an error if they consume too much memory.

 - Changed the ``QueryStats`` JMX MBean to deliver node-based values instead of
   cluster-based values.

   This makes it possible to spot performance discrepancies between nodes more
   easily.

Fixes
-----

 - Fixed a ``COPY FROM`` issue that caused imports into tables with certain
   combinations of ``PARTITIONED BY``, ``PRIMARY KEY`` and
   ``GENERATED COLUMNS`` to fail.

 - Fixed an issue with algorithm that tries to reorder the joined tables using
   the optimum ordering. The issue caused an exception to be thrown when join
   conditions contain table(s) which are not part of the adjacent joined
   tables. E.g.::

     SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 JOIN t3 JOIN t4 ON t4.id = t2.id

 - Fixed an issue that led to ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`` on
   ``DISTINCT`` or ``GROUP BY`` queries on the ``sys.shards`` table.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause ``sys.operations`` entries to remain even
   after the operation has finished.

 - Optimized the JMX ``QueryStats`` MBean to prevent it from putting too much
   load on the cluster.

 - Fixed the calculation of the ``OverallQueryAverageDuration`` ``QueryStats``
   MBean.

 - The internal ``fetchSize`` is now dynamic based on configured heap and has
   an upper bound to prevent ``OutOfMemory`` errors if a postgres client
   retrieves a large result set without setting a ``fetchSize``, or setting a
   ``fetchSize`` which is too large.

 - Fixed a race condition that could lead to ``KILL (ALL)`` causing queries to
   get stuck instead of interrupting them.

 - Fix an issued that cause a ``NullPointerException`` when ordering by system
   columns.

 - Fixed validation so that ``SELECT DISTINCT`` can be used only if there
   is no ``GROUP BY`` present or if the set of ``GROUP BY`` expressions is
   the same as the set ``SELECT`` expressions.

 - Added validation that ``ORDER BY`` symbols are included in the ``SELECT``
   list when ``DISTINCT`` is used.
