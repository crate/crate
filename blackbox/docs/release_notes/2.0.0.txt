Version 2.0.0
=============

Released on 2017/05/16.

.. CAUTION::

   :ref:`version_1.2.0` introduced a significant number of breaking changes. It
   was decided after the fact to communicate this by incrementing the major
   version number for the next release. Be sure to consult the 1.2.0 release
   notes before upgrading to 2.0.0

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB
   :ref:`version_1.1.3` or higher before you upgrade to 2.0.0.

   You cannot perform a :ref:`cluster_upgrade` to this version. Any upgrade to
   this version will require a full cluster restart.

.. WARNING::

   Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changes
=======

 - Extended the subselect support. See :ref:`SELECT Reference
   <sql_reference_subselect>` for details.

 - Added support for ``CREATE USER`` and ``DROP USER``.

 - Added support for opening and closing a table or single partition.

 - Information on the state of tables/partitions is now exposed by a new column
   ``closed`` on the ``information_schema.tables`` and
   ``information_schema.table_partitions`` tables.

 - Added full support for ``DISTINCT`` on queries where ``GROUP BY`` is
   present.

 - UDC pings will send ``licence.ident`` if defined from now on.

 - Added support for host based authentication (HBA) via the Postgres Wire
   Protocol. Please see :ref:`Host Based Authentication <administration_hba>`.

 - Added support for ``GROUP BY`` in combination with subselect. E.g.::

     SELECT x, COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT x FROM t LIMIT 1) as tt GROUP BY x;

 - Implemented hash sum scalar functions (MD5, SHA1). Please see
   :ref:`sha1 <sha1>`.

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed validation so that ``SELECT DISTINCT`` can be used only if there is no
   ``GROUP BY`` present or if the set of ``GROUP BY`` expressions is the same
   as the set ``SELECT`` expressions.

 - Added validation that ``ORDER BY`` symbols are included in the ``SELECT``
   list when ``DISTINCT`` is used.

 - Removed ``psql.enabled`` and ``psql.port`` settings from ``sys.cluster``
   because they where wrongly exposed in this table.

 - Fixed an issue which caused failing ``sys.snapshot`` queries if the
   `data.path` of an existing fs repository was not configured anymore.

 - Use the region of the EC2 instance for EC2 discovery when neither
   ``cloud.aws.ec2.endpoint`` nor ``cloud.aws.region`` are specified or do not
   resolve in a valid service endpoint.

 - Changed CrateDB favicon.

 - ``sys.snapshot`` queries hung instead of throwing an error if something
   went wrong.

 - Fixed an issue which lead to brief unavailability of already registered
   functions after a function was created or dropped in the same schema.

 - Fixed appearance of ``NullPointerException`` in log during startup of crate.

 - Fixed that ``Log4j`` yields a "No log4j2 configuration file found" error
   when shutting down crate ungracefully (via kill signal).

 - Fixed that restoring empty partitioned tables wasn't possible.
