=============
Version 1.0.4
=============

Released on 2017/02/24.

Changelog
=========

 - Fixed an issue which caused restoring a whole partitioned table from a
   snapshot to fail.

 - Fixed the low/high disk-based shard allocation watermark settings. When a
   percentage value is provided for either of settings, it won't be converted to
   an absolute byte value.

 - Fix: Index columns based on string arrays are correctly populated with
   values.

 - Updated crate-admin to 1.0.5 which includes the following change:

    - Fixed a console results issue that caused the results table not to be
      displayed after horizontal scrolling.

    - Fixed an issue that caused the admin-ui to load only one plugin.

    - Display warning in the console view when the query result contains an
      unsafe integer.

    - Relocated the help resources section to be underneath the tweet import
      tutorial.

    - Show loading indicator when ``Execute Query`` is in progress.

 - Fixed evaluation on ``UPDATE`` of generated columns without referenced
   columns, e.g. generated columns with a ``CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`` expression.

 - Fixed global aggregations on JOINs with 3 or more tables.

 - Removed limitation which didn't allow ordering on partitioned columns in a
   ``GROUP BY`` query.
