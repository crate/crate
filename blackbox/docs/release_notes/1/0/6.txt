Version 1.0.6
=============

Released on 2017/04/03.

Changelog
=========

 - Fixed issue which prevents blob directories from being removed after a
   ``drop blob table`` command when a custom blob location is configured.

 - Fixed an issue that caused conditions like ``not x = any( )`` to not
   find empty lists when used in WHERE clauses.

 - Improved error handling when using LIMIT/OFFSET that exceed Integer range

 - Fixed a race condition in an unsorted right outer join with one empty table
   that could lead to incorrect results.

 - Division by aggregation that resulted in 0
   (e.g. SELECT max(long_col) / min(long_col) from t) now correctly returns
   ArtithmeticException and does not hang any more.

 - Fixed a race condition in `KILL` statements which lead to a memory leak.

 - Fixed an issue that prevent a node from starting on Windows if the
   sigar-plugin is removed.
