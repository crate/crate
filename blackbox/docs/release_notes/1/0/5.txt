Version 1.0.5
=============

Released on 2017/03/14.

Changelog
=========

 - Fix: Case sensivity of aliases wasn't handled correctly. Aliases are now
   fully case sensitive.

 - Fixed a race condition that could have caused that not all columns were
   written to the metadata when a lot of new dynamic columns were generated
   concurrently.

 - Fixed an issue that caused joins on ``information_schema.columns`` to
   produce a wrong result if ``information_schema.columns`` was used as the
   right table.
