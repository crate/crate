=============

Released on 2017/02/10.

Changelog
=========

 - DEPRECATED: multicast discovery has been deprecated in this release, and will
   be removed in the 1.1 release. Multicast discovery is disabled by default.

 - Fix: Allow scalar functions on the `HAVING` clause if the scalar function is
   used as a `GROUP BY` symbol.

 - Return correct affected row count instead of throwing an exception when
   trying to bulk insert values that don't match the column type(s).

 - Fixed an issue in the postgres protocol that could cause a StackOverflow
   exception due to connection errors or malfunctioning clients.

 - Removed ``OVER`` support from SQL parser because the clause was completely
   ignored when executing the query which led to misleading results.

 - Fix: Closing a connection via the Postgres Wire Protocol correctly closes the
   internal resources.

 - Queries with ``_doc`` reference comparison (e.g. ``_doc['name'] = 'foo'``)
   in the ``WHERE`` clause return the correct results instead of empty result.

 - Fixed issue that led to casting exception when comparing an object column
   with an object literal that contains a string value.

 - Dynamically added string columns now have exactly the same characteristics
   as string columns created via ``CREATE TABLE`` or ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN``

 - Fixed and issue that caused ``UPDATE`` statement on an empty partitioned
   table to throw UnsupportedOperationException.

 - Fixed an issue that caused fulltext search with ``fuzziness='AUTO'``
   to throw ``NumberFormatException``.

 - Fixed an issue in the ``LIKE`` predicate which prevented from using escaped
   backslash before the wildcard.

 - Updated crate-admin to ``1.0.4`` which includes the following change:

     - Fixed getting started display issue on very wide screens.

 - Fixed an issue that caused ``ORDER BY`` clause to be ignored if used
   in combination with ``GROUP BY`` in subselects. e.g.::

       SELECT x from (SELECT * from t1) as tt
       GROUP BY x ORDER BY x`
