    - Fix intercom support that disappeared during the implementation of the
      new admin-ui layout.

    - Fix Radio button position in load overview.

    - Made schema tabs more distinguishable from tables in the table list.

    - Updated link to support website in contact widget.

 - Fixed scalar signature registration, NULL literals are now supported.

 - Fixed usage of aggregations with NULL values, no exception will be thrown
   anymore but instead NULL values are properly processed.

 - Fix: ``chunk_size`` and ``buffer_size`` settings for creating repositories
   of type ``S3`` are not parsed correctly.

 - Fix: error thrown when ``ANY`` or ``ALL`` array comparison expressions
   are used in ``SELECT`` list. e.g.::

       select 'foo' = any(some_array)

 - ``INSERT`` statements now support ``SELECT`` statements without parentheses.

 - Fixed an issue that could lead to incorrect results if the ``WHERE`` clause
   contains primary key comparisons together with other functions like match.

 - Fixed an issue that caused select queries with bulk arguments to hang
   instead of throwing the proper error.

 - Fixed a rare race condition that could happen on select queries during a
   shard relocation leading to a ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`` or a wrong
   result.

 - Fix: Creating new partitions could have failed in case the partitioned table
   was created prior to CrateDB version 0.55.0 and the table contained a
   ``object`` column.
