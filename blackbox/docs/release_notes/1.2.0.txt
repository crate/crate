.. _version_1.2.0:

=============
Version 1.2.0
=============

Released on 2017/04/24.

.. CAUTION::

   This release introduced a significant number of breaking changes. It was
   decided after the fact to communicate this by incrementing the major version
   number for the next release.

   We recommend that you consult the 1.2.0 release notes for informational
   purposes only, and proceed directly to :ref:`version_2.0.0`.

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB
   :ref:`version_1.1.3` or higher before you upgrade to 1.2.0.

   You cannot perform a :ref:`cluster_upgrade` to this version. Any upgrade to
   this version will require a full cluster restart.

.. WARNING::

   Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Breaking Changes
================

 - To accommodate user-defined functions, some new reserved keywords have been
   added to the CrateDB SQL dialect: ``RETURNS``, ``CALLED``, ``REPLACE``,
   ``FUNCTION``, ``LANGUAGE``, ``INPUT``

 - The :ref:`conf_enterprise_license` setting is set to ``true`` by default.
   This enables the CrateDB `Enterprise Edition`_.

   Once you have evaluated the `Enterprise Edition`_ of CrateDB, you must
   either buy an enterprise license, or disable this setting.

   If you disable this setting, CrateDB will run with the standard feature set.

 - The default value of the ``node.max_local_storage_nodes`` node setting has
   been changed to ``1`` to prevent running multiple nodes on the same data
   path by default.

   Previous versions of CrateDB defaulted to allowing up to 50 nodes running on
   the same data path. This was confusing where users accidentally started
   multiple nodes and ended up thinking they have lost data because the second
   node will start with an empty directory.

   Running multiple nodes on the same data path tends to be an exception,
   so this is a safer default.

 - Parsing support of time values has been changed:

   - The unit ``w`` representing weeks is no longer supported.

   - Fractional time values (e.g. ``0.5s``) are no longer supported. For
     example, this means when setting timeouts, ``0.5s`` will be rejected and
     should instead be input as ``500ms``.

 - The already unused ``path.work`` node setting has been removed.

 - The node setting ``bootstrap.mlockall`` has been renamed to
   ``bootstrap.memory_lock``.

 - The ``keyword_repeat`` and ``type_as_payload`` built-in token filter have
   been removed.

 - The ``classic`` built-in analyzer has been removed.

 - The shard balance related cluster settings
   ``cluster.routing.allocation.balance.primary`` and
   ``cluster.routing.allocation.balance.replica`` have been removed.

 - Some ``recovery`` related cluster settings have been removed or replaced:

   - The ``indices.recovery.concurrent_streams`` cluster setting is now
     superseded by ``cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries``.

   - The ``indices.recovery.activity_timeout`` cluster setting have been
     renamed to ``indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout``.

   - Following ``recovery`` cluster settings have been removed:

     - ``indices.recovery.file_chunk_size``

     - ``indices.recovery.translog_ops``

     - ``indices.recovery.translog_size``

     - ``indices.recovery.compress``

 - Logging is now configured by ``log4j2.properties`` instead of
   ``logging.yml``.

 - The plugin interface has changed, injecting classes on ``shard`` or
   ``index`` levels is no longer supported.

 - It's no longer possible to run CrateDB as the unix ``root`` user.

 - Some translog related table settings have been removed or replaced:

   - The ``index.translog.interval``, ``translog.disable_flush`` and
     ``translog.flush_threshold_period`` table settings have been removed.

   - The ``index.translog.sync_interval`` table setting doesn’t accept a value
     less than ``100ms`` which prevents fsyncing too often if async durability
     is enabled. The special value ``0`` is no longer supported.

   - The ``index.translog.flush_threshold_ops`` table setting is not supported
     anymore. In order to control flushes based on the transaction log growth
     use ``index.translog.flush_threshold_size`` instead.

 - The ``COPY FROM`` statement now requires column names to be quoted in the
   JSON file being imported.

 - Queries on columns with ``INDEX OFF`` will now fail instead of always
   resulting in an empty result.

 - Configuration support using system properties has been dropped.

 - It's no longer possible to use ``Hadoop 1.x`` as a ``repository`` for
   snapshots.

 - Changed default bind and publish address from ``0.0.0.0`` to the system
   ``loopback`` addresses.

 - The ``discovery.ec2.ping_timeout`` setting has been removed and the
   ``discovery.zen.ping_timeout`` setting is now also used for EC2 discovery.

 - The ``monitor.jvm.gc.[old|young].[debug|info|warn]`` settings used to
   configure logging of garbage collection have been renamed (adding
   ``collector``) to
   ``monitor.jvm.gc.collector.[old|young].[debug|info|warn]``.

 - Recovery timeout settings changes:

     - ``indices.recovery.retry_internal_action_timeout`` has been renamed to
       ``indices.recovery.internal_action_timeout``
     - ``indices.recovery.retry_internal_long_action_timeout`` has been renamed
       to ``indices.recovery.internal_action_long_timeout``
     - ``indices.recovery.retry_activity_timeout`` has been renamed to
       ``indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout``

Changes
=======

 - Admin UI improvements.

 - Added support for ``GROUP BY`` on joins.

 - The license identifier is now displayed in the Enterprise Edition.

 - Added support for user-defined functions.

 - Added JavaScript language for functions.

 - Added cluster check and warning for unlicensed usage of CrateDB Enterprise.

 - Added ``license.ident`` setting.

 - Added built-in ``fingerprint``, ``keep_types``, ``min_hash`` and
   ``serbian_normalization`` token filter.

 - Added a ``fingerprint`` built-in analyzer.

 - Upgraded to Elasticsearch 5.0.2.

 - Improved performance of blob stats computation by calculating them in an
   incremental manner.

 - Optimized performance of negation queries on ``NOT NULL`` columns.
   e.g.::

     SELECT * FROM t WHERE not_null_col != 10

 - Updated documentation to indicate that it's not possible to use ``object``,
   ``geo_point``, ``geo_shape``, or ``array`` in the ``ORDER BY`` clause.

Fixes
=====

 - Fix: Usage of ``DISTINCT`` in a query with a ``GROUP BY`` was producing
   wrong results and  was changed to throw ``UnsupportedOperationException``.
   e.g.::

     SELECT DISTINCT col1 from t1 GROUP BY col2, col1

 - Fix: An error was thrown when using ``ORDER BY count(*)`` on ``JOINS``.
   e.g.::

      SELECT count(*) from t1, t2 order by 1
