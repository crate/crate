.. _version_1.2.0:

=============
Version 1.2.0
=============

Released on 2017/04/18.

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB
   :ref:`version_1.1.2` or higher before you upgrade to 1.2.0.

   You cannot perform a :ref:`cluster_upgrade` to this version. Any upgrade to
   this version will require a full cluster restart.

.. WARNING::

   Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. _back up your data: https://crate.io/a/backing-up-and-restoring-crate/

Breaking Changes
================

 - To accommodate user-defined functions, some new reserved keywords have been
   added to the CrateBD dialect: ``RETURNS``, ``CALLED`, ``REPLACE``,
   ``FUNCTION``, ``LANGUAGE``, ``INPUT``

 - The ``enterprise.license`` setting is set to ``true`` by default.
   If you do not configure a valid license, and you do not disable this
   setting, you will be running CrateDB in unlicensed mode.

 - The ``enterprise.license`` setting is set to ``true`` by default.  
   This enables the CrateDB `enterprise edition`_.  
   Once you have evaluated the `enterprise edition`_ of CrateDB, you must
   either buy an enterprise license, or disable this setting.  
   If you disable this setting, CrateDB will run with the standard feature set.
.. _enterprise edition: https://crate.io/enterprise-edition/

 - The default value of the ``node.max_local_storage_nodes`` node setting has
   been changed to ``1`` to prevent running multiple nodes on the same data
   path by default.  
   Previous versions of CrateDB defaulted to allowing up to ``50`` nodes
   running on the same data path. This was confusing where users accidentally
   started multiple nodes and ended up thinking they have lost data because the
   second node will start with an empty directory.  
   Running multiple nodes on the same data path tends to be an exception,
   so defaulting towards safer out-of-the-box settings is reasonable.

 - Parsing support of time values has been changed:

   - The unit ``w`` representing weeks is no longer supported.

   - Fractional time values (e.g. ``0.5s``) are no longer supported. For
     example, this means when setting timeouts, ``0.5s`` will be rejected and
     should instead be input as ``500ms``.

 - The already unused ``path.work`` node setting has been removed.

 - The node setting ``bootstrap.mlockall`` has been renamed to
   ``bootstrap.memory_lock``.

 - The ``keyword_repeat`` and ``type_as_payload`` built-in token filter have
   been removed.

 - The ``classic`` built-in analyzer has been removed.

 - The shard balance related cluster settings
   ``cluster.routing.allocation.balance.primary`` and
   ``cluster.routing.allocation.balance.replica`` have been removed.

 - Some ``recovery`` related cluster settings have been removed or replaced:

   - The ``indices.recovery.concurrent_streams`` cluster setting is now
     superseded by ``cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries``.

   - The ``indices.recovery.activity_timeout`` cluster setting have beend
     renamed to ``indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout``.

   - Following ``recovery`` cluster settings have been removed:

     - ``indices.recovery.file_chunk_size``

     - ``indices.recovery.translog_ops``

     - ``indices.recovery.translog_size``

     - ``indices.recovery.compress``

 - Logging is now configured by ``log4j2.properties`` instead of
   ``logging.yml``.

 - The plugin interface has changed, injecting classes on ``shard`` or
   ``index`` levels is no longer supported.

 - It's no longer possible to run crate as the unix ``root`` user.

 - Some ``translog`` related table settings have been removed or replaced:

   - The ``index.translog.interval``, ``translog.disable_flush`` and
     ``translog.flush_threshold_period`` table settings have been removed.

   - The ``index.translog.sync_interval`` table setting doesn’t accept a value
     less than 100ms which prevents fsyncing too often if async durability is
     enabled. The special value ``0`` is no longer supported.

   - The ``index.translog.flush_threshold_ops`` table setting is not supported
     anymore. In order to control flushes based on the transaction log growth
     use ``index.translog.flush_threshold_size`` instead.

 - The ``COPY FROM`` statement now requires column names to be quoted in the
   JSON file being imported.

 - Queries on columns with ``INDEX OFF`` will now fail instead of always
   resulting in an empty result.

 - Configuration support using system properties has been dropped.

 - It's no longer possible to use ``Hadoop 1.x`` as a ``repository`` for
   snapshots.

 - Changed default bind and publish address from ``0.0.0.0`` to the system
   ``loopback`` addresses.

Changes
=======
