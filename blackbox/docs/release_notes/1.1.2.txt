.. _version_1.1.2:

=============
Version 1.1.2
=============

Released on 2017/04/17.

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 0.57.0 or higher
   before you upgrade to 1.1.1.

   You cannot perform a :ref:`cluster_upgrade` to this version. Any upgrade to
   this version will require a full cluster restart.

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed a bug which caused non-grouping aggregations on a join with explicit
   ``CROSS JOIN`` syntax to fail.

 - Correctly expose ``stats.service.interval`` in the ``sys.cluster``
   table.

 - Re-added compatibility layer that was removed in 1.1 and resulted in
   exception thrown when trying to run aggregations on tables created
   with CrateDB < 0.52.0.

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause a memory leak.

 - Updated documentation to indicate that it's not possible to use
    ``object``, ``geo_point``, ``geo_shape`` or ``array`` in the
    ``ORDER BY`` clause.

 - Fixed cluster check, which warns about tables that need upgrade for
   future compatibility, to include only tables that differ from
   current storage engine major version number.

 - Fixed issue which prevents blob directories from being removed after a
   ``drop blob table`` command when a custom blob location is configured.
