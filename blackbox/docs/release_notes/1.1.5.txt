Fixes
=====

 - Fixed an issue that leads to an exception if the statement evaluates on
   arrays that are provided in an aggregation function.

 - Fixed a performance regression that could cause JOIN queries to execute
   slower than they used to.

 - Return proper exception when group by is used on scalar functions that are
   applied to an aggregation.

 - Fixed an issue that causes aliases used in the select list to get lost on
   subselect queries.

 - The correct error messages and codes are now thrown for REST actions.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause non-grouping aggregations on virtual tables
   to return the wrong result.

 - Fixed a bug in the memory accounting of the circuit breaker for HTTP results
   when querying ``GEO_SHAPE`` columns.

 - Reflect internally used default size for ``translog.flush_threshold_size``
   also in documentation and expose the correct default value in table
   settings.
