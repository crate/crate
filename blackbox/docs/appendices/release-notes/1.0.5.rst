Fixes
-----

 - Case sensivity of aliases wasn't handled correctly. Aliases are now fully
   case sensitive.

 - Fixed a race condition that could have caused that not all columns were
   written to the metadata when a lot of new dynamic columns were generated
   concurrently.

 - Fixed an issue that caused joins on ``information_schema.columns`` to
   produce a wrong result if ``information_schema.columns`` was used as the
   right table.
