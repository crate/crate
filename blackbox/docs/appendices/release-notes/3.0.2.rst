.. _version_3.0.2:

=============
Version 3.0.2
=============

Released on 2018/06/12.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.0.2.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 2.3 release before moving to
    3.0.2.

    You cannot perform a `rolling upgrade`_ to this version. Any upgrade to this
    version will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

    Please consult the :ref:`version_3.0.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.0 and must be recreated before moving to 3.0.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog

Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue that caused an UnsupportedFeatureException to be thrown for
  queries with a ``WHERE`` clause which contains an equality comparison that
  references a table column in both sides. E.g.::

    SELECT * FROM t
    WHERE t.i = abs(t.i)

- Fixed an issue that could cause a cluster check warning, telling the user to
  upgrade tables which do not require upgrades.

- Fixed an issue that could cause ``HTTP`` requests using empty ``bulk_args``
  to fail.

- Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` which could be thrown when deleting a table
  and querying the ``size`` column from the ``sys.shards`` table.
