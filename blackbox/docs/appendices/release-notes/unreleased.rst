Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that led to DEFAULT constraints of inner columns of object
  columns to be ignored.

- The values provided in INSERT or UPDATE statements for object columns which
  contain generated expressions are now validated. The computed expression must
  match the provided value. This makes the behavior consistent with how top
  level columns of a table are treated.

- Fixed support for ordering by literal constants.
  Example: ``SELECT 1, * FROM t ORDER BY 1"``
