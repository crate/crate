Breaking Changes
================

- Renamed column `information_schema.table_partitions.schema_name` to
  `table_schema`.

- Renamed CrateDB data types to the corresponding PostgreSQL data types.

   +--------------+----------------------+
   | Current Name | New Name             |
   +==============+======================+
   | ``short``    | ``smallint``         |
   +--------------+----------------------+
   | ``long``     | ``bigint``           |
   +--------------+----------------------+
   | ``float``    | ``real``             |
   +--------------+----------------------+
   | ``double``   | ``double precision`` |
   +--------------+----------------------+
   | ``byte``     | ``char``             |
   +--------------+----------------------+
   | ``string``   | ``text``             |
   +--------------+----------------------+

  See :ref:`data-types` for more detailed information. The old data type names
  are registered as aliases for backward comparability.

- Removed the deprecated ``license.enterprise`` setting. To use CrateDB without
  any enterprise features one should use the Community Edition instead.

- Removed the HTTP pipelining functionality. We are not aware of any client
  using this functionality.

- Changed the ordering of columns to be based on their position in the
  :ref:`CREATE TABLE <ref-create-table>` statement. This was done to improve
  compatibility with PostgreSQL and will affect queries like ``SELECT * FROM``
  or ``INSERT INTO <table> VALUES (...)``

- Changed the default :ref:`column_policy` on tables from ``dynamic`` to
  ``strict``. Columns of type object still default to ``dynamic``.

- Removed the deprecated ``license.ident`` setting.

- Removed the deprecated ``USR2`` signal handling. Use :ref:`ALTER CLUSTER
  DECOMISSION <alter_cluster_decommission>` instead. Be aware that the
  behavior of sending ``USR2`` signals to a CrateDB process is now undefined
  and up to the JVM. In some cases it may still terminate the instance but
  without clean shutdown.

- Renamed ``information_schema.columns.user_defined_type_*`` columns to
  ``information_schema_columns.udt_*`` for SQL standard compatibility.

- Changed type of column ``information_schema.columns.is_generated`` to ``STRING``
  with value ``NEVER`` or ``ALWAYS`` for SQL standard compatibility.

- Removed the deprecated average duration and query frequency JMX metrics. The
  total counts and sum of durations as documented in :ref:`query_stats_mbean`
  should be used instead.

- Removed the deprecated setting ``cluster.graceful_stop.reallocate``.

- Removed the deprecated ``ON DUPLICATE KEY`` syntax of :ref:`ref-insert`
  statements.

- Dropped support for Java versions < 11

- The Elasticsearch REST API has been removed.

- Changed the layout of the ``version`` column in the
  ``information_schema.tables`` and ``information_schema.table_partitions``
  tables. The version is now displayed directly under ``created`` and
  ``upgraded``. The ``cratedb`` and ``elasticsearch`` sub-category has been
  removed.

- Removed the ``index`` thread-pool and the ``bulk`` alias for the ``write``
  thread-pool. The JMX ``getBulk`` property of the ``ThreadPools`` bean has
  been renamed too ``getWrite``.

- Removed the deprecated ``http.enabled`` setting. ``HTTP`` is now always
  enabled and can no longer be disabled.

- Removed the deprecated ``ingest`` framework, including the ``MQTT`` endpoint.


Deprecations
============

- Marked SynonymFilter tokenizer as deprecated.

- Marked LowerCase tokenizer as deprecated.

Changes
=======

- Removed deprecated ``nGram``, ``edgeNGram`` token filter and ``htmlStrip``
  char filter, they are superseded by ``ngram``, ``edge_ngram`` and
  ``html_strip``.

- Added :ref:`current_setting <scalar_current_setting>` system information
  scalar function that yields the current value of the setting.

- Added support for the ``PARTITION BY`` clause in :ref:`window-functions`.

- Upgraded to Lucene 8.0.0, and as part of this the BM25 scoring has changed.
  The order of the scores remain the same, but the values of the scores differ.
  Fulltext queries including ``_score`` filters may behave slightly different.

- Added :ref:`quote_ident <scalar-quote-ident>` scalar string function that
  quotes a string if it is needed.

- Added missing Postgresql type mapping for the ``array(ip)`` collection type.

- Added a new ``_docid`` :ref:`system column
  <sql_administration_system_columns>`.

- Added :ref:`trim <scalar-trim>` scalar string function that trims
  the (leading, trailing or both) set of characters from an input string.

- Added :ref:`string_to_array <scalar-string-to-array>` scalar array function
  that splits an input string into an array of string elements using a
  separator and a null-string.

- Added support for subscript expressions on an object column of a sub-relation.
  Examples: ``select a['b'] from (select a from t1)`` or ``select a['b'] from
  my_view`` where ``my_view`` is defined as ``select a from t1``.

- Added support for :ref:`sql_escape_string_literals`.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could cause a query with window functions and limit to
  return too few rows or have the window functions compute wrong results.

- Fixed an issue that would cause a ``ClassCastException`` for queries ordered
  by a window function.
