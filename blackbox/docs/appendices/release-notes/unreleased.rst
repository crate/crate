    These changes have not yet been released.

    If you are viewing this document on the Crate.io website, these changes
    reflect what exists on `the master branch`_ in Git. This is where we
    collect changes before they are ready for release.

.. WARNING::

    Unreleased changes may not be ready for general use and could lead to data
    corruption or data loss. You should `back up your data`_ before
    experimenting with unreleased changes.

Breaking Changes
================

- Renamed ``information_schema.columns.user_defined_type_*`` columns to
  ``information_schema_columns.udt_*`` for SQL standard compatibility.

- Changed type of column ``information_schema.columns.is_generated`` to ``STRING``
  with value ``NEVER`` or ``ALWAYS`` for SQL standard compatibility.

- Removed the deprecated average duration and query frequency JMX metrics. The
  total counts and sum of durations as documented in :ref:`query_stats_mbean`
  should be used instead.

- Removed the deprecated setting ``cluster.graceful_stop.reallocate``.

- Removed the deprecated ``ON DUPLICATE KEY`` syntax of :ref:`ref-insert`
  statements.

- Dropped support for Java versions < 11

- The Elasticsearch REST API has been removed.

- Changed the layout of the ``version`` column in the
  ``information_schema.tables`` and ``information_schema.table_partitions``
  tables. The version is now displayed directly under ``created`` and
  ``upgraded``. The ``cratedb`` and ``elasticsearch`` sub-category has been
  removed.

- Removed the ``index`` thread-pool and the ``bulk`` alias for the ``write``
  thread-pool. The JMX ``getBulk`` property of the ``ThreadPools`` bean has
  been renamed too ``getWrite``.

- Removed the deprecated ``http.enabled`` setting. ``HTTP`` is now always
  enabled and can no longer be disabled.

- Removed the deprecated ``ingest`` framework, including the ``MQTT`` endpoint.


Deprecations
============

- The query frequency and average duration :ref:`query_stats_mbean` metrics
  have been deprecated in favour of the new total count and sum of durations
  metrics.

- Marked the ``cluster.graceful_stop.reallocate`` setting as deprecated.
  This setting was already being ignored, setting the value to `false` has
  no effect.

- The node decommission using the ``USR2`` :ref:`cli_signals` has been
  deprecated in favour of the
  :ref:`ALTER CLUSTER DECOMISSION <alter_cluster_decommission>` statement.

- Marked ``CREATE INGEST RULE`` and ``DROP INGEST RULE`` as deprecated.
  Given that the only implementation (MQTT) was deprecated and will be removed,
  the framework itself will also be removed.

Changes
=======

- The :ref:`usage_data_collector` now includes information about the available
  number of processors.

- Added support for :ref:`sql_escape_string_literals`.

- Expose the sum of durations, total, and failed count metrics under the
  :ref:`query_stats_mbean` for ``QUERY``, ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``,
  ``MANAGEMENT``, ``DDL`` and ``COPY`` statement types.

- Expose the sum of statement durations, total, and failed count classified by
  statement type under the sum_of_durations, total_count and failed_count
  columns, respectively, in the :ref:`sys-jobs-metrics` table.

- Added a node check that checks the JVM version under which CrateDB is
  running. We recommend users to upgrade to JVM 11 as support for older
  versions will be dropped in the future.

- Added ``ALTER CLUSTER DECOMMISSION <nodeId | nodeName>`` statement that
  triggers the existing node decommission functionality.

- Added ``pg_type.typlen``, ``pg_type.typarray`` and ``pg_type.typnamespace``
  columns for improved postgresql compatibility.

- Added ``current_schemas(boolean)`` scalar function which will return the
  names of schemas in the ``search_path``.

- Added support for the ``first_value``, ``last_value`` and ``nth_value``
  window functions as enterprise features.

- Implemented the ``DROP ANALYZER`` statement to support removal of custom
  analyzer definitions from the cluster.

- Output the custom analyzer/tokenizer/token_filter/char_filter definition inside
  the ``information_schema.routines.routine_definition`` column.

- Added a ``pg_description`` table to the ``pg_catalog`` schema for improved
  postgresql compatibility.

- Added support for window function ``row_number()``.

- Added support to use any expression in the operand of a ``CASE`` clause.

- Buffer the file output of ``COPY TO`` operations to improve performance by not
  writing to disk on every row.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed circuit breaker memory accounting of window functions to prevent OOM
  exceptions.
