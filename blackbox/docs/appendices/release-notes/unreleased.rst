Changes
=======

- Added an optimization that allows to run `WHERE` clauses on top of
  derived tables containing :ref:`table functions <ref-table-functions>`
  more efficiently in some cases.

- Statements containing limits, filters, window functions or table functions
  will now be labelled accordingly in :ref:`sys-jobs-metrics`.

- Added support for the :ref:`named window definition <named-windows>`.
  It allows a user to define a list of window definitions in the
  :ref:`sql_reference_window` clause that can be referenced in :ref:`over`
  clauses.

- Add support for ``ROWS`` frame definitions in the context of window functions
  :ref:`window definitions <window-definition>`.

- The ``node`` argument of the :ref:`REROUTE <alter_table_reroute>` commands of
  :ref:`ref-alter-table` can now either be the id or the name of a node.

- Added a :ref:`PROMOTE REPLICA <alter_table_reroute>` sub command to
  :ref:`ref-alter-table`.

- Added support for the :ref:`lag <window-function-lag>` and
  :ref:`lead <window-function-lead>` window functions as enterprise features.

- Changed the default for :ref:`sql_ref_write_wait_for_active_shards` from
  ``ALL`` to ``1``. This will improve the out of box experience as it allows a
  subset of nodes to become unavailable without blocking write operations. See
  the documentation for more details about the implications.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue in the version handling that would prevent rolling upgrades to
  future versions of CrateDB.

- Arithmetic operations now work on expressions of type :ref:`timestamp without
  time zone <date-time-types>`, to make it consistent with ``timestamp with time
  zone``.
