Breaking Changes
================

- The Elasticsearch REST API has been removed.

- Changed the layout of the ``version`` column in the
  ``information_schema.tables`` and ``information_schema.table_partitions``
  tables. The version is now displayed directly under ``created`` and
  ``upgraded``. The ``cratedb`` and ``elasticsearch`` sub-category has been
  removed.

Changes
=======

- Added the ``pg_type.typlen`` column for improved postgresql compatibility.

- Marked ``CREATE INGEST RULE`` and ``DROP INGEST RULE`` as deprecated. Given
  that the only implementation (MQTT) was deprecated and will be removed, the
  framework itself will also be removed.

- Added ``current_schemas(boolean)`` scalar function which will return the
  names of schemas in the ``search_path``.

- Added support for the ``first_value``, ``last_value`` and ``nth_value``
  window functions as enterprise features.

- Implemented the ``DROP ANALYZER`` statement to support removal of custom
  analyzer definitions from the cluster.

- Output the custom analyzer/tokenizer/token_filter/char_filter definition inside
  the ``information_schema.routines.routine_definition`` column.


- Added a ``pg_description`` table to the ``pg_catalog`` schema for improved
  postgresql compatibility.

- Added support for window function ``row_number()``.

- Added support to use any expression in the operand of a ``CASE`` clause.

- Buffer the file output of ``COPY TO`` operations to improve performance by not
  writing to disk on every row.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` that could occur on queries on the
  ``information_schema.tables`` table.

- Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` that occurs on ``OUTER`` joins which can
  be rewritten to ``INNER`` joins and uses a function as a select item.
