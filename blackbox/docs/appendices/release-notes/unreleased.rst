Fixes
=====

- Fixed regression that prevented shards from reallocation when a node passes
  over :ref:`cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high
  <cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high>`.

- Removed a case where a ``NullPointerException`` was logged if a HTTP client
  disconnected before a pending response could be sent to the client.
