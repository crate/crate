Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused the users list in the privileges tab to not
  displayed when the CrateDB Admin UI is not served from ``/``.

- Fixed various issues in the CrateDB Admin UI console.

- Fixed an issue that caused the Twitter tutorial to not start automatically
  after the login redirect in the CrateDB Admin UI.

- Fixed an issue that prevented subqueries from being used in select item
  expressions that also contain a reference accessed via a relation alias.
  For example: ``SELECT t.y IN (SELECT x FROM t2) FROM t1 t``

- Fail the storage engine if indexing on a replica shard fails after it was
  successfully done on a primary shard. It prevents replica and primary shards
  from going out of sync.

- Fixed bug in the disk threshold decider logic that would ignore to account
  new relocating shard (``STARTED`` to ``RELOCATING``) when deciding how to
  allocate or relocate shards with respect to
  :ref:`cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low
  <cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low>` and
  :ref:`cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high
  <cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high>` settings.

- Fixed regression that prevented shards from reallocation when a node passes
  over :ref:`cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high
  <cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high>`.

- Removed a case where a ``NullPointerException`` was logged if a HTTP client
  disconnected before a pending response could be sent to the client.
