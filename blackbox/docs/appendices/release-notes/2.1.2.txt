=============

Released on 2017/08/08.

If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB
:ref:`version_1.1.3` or higher before you upgrade to 2.1.2.

If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
number must be :ref:`version_2.1.0`.  If you want to upgrade from a version
prior to this, the upgrade will introduce all of the breaking changes listed
for :ref:`version_2.1.0`, and will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

Consult the :ref:`version_2.1.0_upgrade_notes` for ``2.1.0`` when upgrading.

   Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.
