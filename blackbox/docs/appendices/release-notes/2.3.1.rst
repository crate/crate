Changelog
=========

Changes
-------

- In certain cases it's no longer necessary to explicitly add generated columns
  that are part of a composite primary key to the ``WHERE`` clause in order to
  get an execution plan with real-time semantics.

- Greatly improved performance of queries that uses scalar functions inside the
  ``WHERE`` clause.

Fixes
-----

- Avoid downcasts in function expressions which could lead to reduced
  precision. For example ::

    SELECT round(float_col) + 1.1 would result in
      SELECT round(float_col) + 1
    but is now resolved to
      SELECT to_float(round(float_col)) + 1.1

- Ensured natural order of config keys for Host Based Authentication.

- Fixed encoding/decoding of ``Timestamp`` type for PostgreSQL wire protocol
  to support Golang psql drivers.

- Fixed an Admin UI issue that caused the ``Cluster`` tab to not be loaded
  correctly.

- Map the Tab key to insert spaces instead of a tab character in the query
  console of the Admin UI.

- Fixed an issue that caused the user name to not be displayed in the Admin UI.
