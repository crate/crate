Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue that caused ``INSERT`` statements using a subquery on the
  ``sys.shards`` system table to fail.

- Fixed an issue that caused wrong results for ``JOIN`` queries on 3 or more
  tables when ``ORDER BY`` clause contains columns from more than one table.

- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect results to be returned for JOIN queries
  when the table stats indicated that the left table of a join is smaller
  than the right.

- Fixed passing arguments that contain spaces in the crate shell script.

- Fixed an issue that caused a table that is not part of the "doc" schema to
  be unavailable/hidden if it gets closed using ``ALTER TABLE``.

- Fixed an issue where the query circuit breaker would be tripped after
  running several queries due to incorrect memory tracking. Subsequent
  operations would have failed due to the lack of circuit breaker cleanup.
