.. _version_3.0.1:

=============
Version 3.0.1
=============

Released on 2018/05/30.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.0.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 2.3 release before moving to
    3.0.1.

    You cannot perform a `rolling upgrade`_ to this version. Any upgrade to this
    version will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

    Please consult the :ref:`version_3.0.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.0 and must be recreated before moving to 3.0.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog

Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue that caused the CrateDB process CPU calculation in the
  Admin-UI to be false.

- Fixed the default log file name to ``crate.log`` if no cluster name was
  explicitly specified in the settings.

- Fixed an issue that caused a ``ClassCastException`` to be thrown when
  querying the ``sys.health`` table on a cluster that has ``blob`` tables.

- Fixed support for views with aliased literals in select list / groupBy /
  orderBy.

- Fixed a bug affecting the Postgres Wire Protocol's Simple Query mode and
  queries which contained strings with escaped single quotes and semicolons,
  e.g. ``'Hello ''Joe'';'``.

- Fixed an issue in the Postgres Wire Protocol's Simple Query mode which would
  send an empty statement if the query string contained trailing whitespace.
