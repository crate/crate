Released on 2016/12/12.

If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 0.57.0 or higher
before you upgrade to 1.0.1.

If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
number must be :ref:`version_1.0.0`. If you want to upgrade from a version
prior to this, the upgrade will introduce all of the breaking changes listed
for :ref:`version_1.0.0`, and will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

Changes
-------

 - ``INSERT`` statements now support ``SELECT`` statements without parentheses.

    - Removed pepper widget, support links are now in a Help section along with

Fixes
-----

 - Fixed scalar signature registration, NULL literals are now supported.

 - Fixed usage of aggregations with NULL values, no exception will be thrown
   anymore but instead NULL values are properly processed.

 - The ``chunk_size`` and ``buffer_size`` settings for creating repositories
   of type ``S3`` are now parsed correctly.

 - CrateDB no longer throws an error when ``ANY`` or ``ALL`` array comparison
   expressions are used in ``SELECT`` list. e.g.::

       select 'foo' = any(some_array)

 - Fixed an issue that could lead to incorrect results if the ``WHERE`` clause
   contains primary key comparisons together with other functions like match.

 - Fixed an issue that caused select queries with bulk arguments to hang
   instead of throwing the proper error.

 - Fixed a rare race condition that could happen on select queries during a
   shard relocation leading to a ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`` or a wrong
   result.

 - Creating new partitions could have failed if the partitioned table was
   created prior to CrateDB version 0.55.0 and the table contained a ``object``
   column. This issue has been fixed.
