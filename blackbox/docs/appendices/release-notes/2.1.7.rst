Fixes
-----

 - Fixed an issue causing global aggregations with ``JOINs`` on virtual tables
   (sub-selects) which contain ``LIMIT`` to return incorrect results. E.g.::

     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
       (SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY a LIMIT 5) t1,
     JOIN
       t2
     ON t1.a = t2.b

 - Fixed an issue that caused an error when trying to create a table with a
   generated column expression of type array.

 - Fixed an issue that caused the ``account_user``-column to be empty in the
   twitter tutorial plugin of the Admin UI.

 - Fixed an issue when using GRANT/REVOKE/DENY statements on a table with a
   custom schema set. The statements would result in permission changed on the
   default ``doc`` schema.

 - Fixed an issue with ``INNER`` and ``CROSS JOINS`` on more than 2 tables that
   could result in a ``Iterator is not on a row`` error.
