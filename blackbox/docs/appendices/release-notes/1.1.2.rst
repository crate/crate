Version 1.1.2
=============

Released on 2017/04/10.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 0.57.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 1.1.2.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be :ref:`version_1.1.1` or higher. If you want to upgrade from a
    version prior to this, the upgrade will introduce all of the breaking
    changes listed for :ref:`version_1.1.0`, and will require a `full restart
    upgrade`_.

.. WARNING::

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========

Fixes
-----

 - Fixed a bug which caused non-grouping aggregations on a join with explicit
   ``CROSS JOIN`` syntax to fail.

 - Correctly expose ``stats.service.interval`` in the ``sys.cluster``
   table.

 - Re-added compatibility layer that was removed in 1.1 and resulted in
   exception thrown when trying to run aggregations on tables created with
   CrateDB < 0.52.0.

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause a memory leak.

 - Updated documentation to indicate that it's not possible to use ``object``,
   ``geo_point``, ``geo_shape`` or ``array`` in the ``ORDER BY`` clause.

 - Fixed cluster check, which warns about tables that need upgrade for future
   compatibility, to include only tables that differ from current storage engine
   major version number.

 - Fixed issue which prevents blob directories from being removed after a
   ``drop blob table`` command when a custom blob location is configured.
