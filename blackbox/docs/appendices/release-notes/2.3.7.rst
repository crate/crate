Changes
-------

- Table functions no longer require any permissions to be used. (Enterprise
  only.)

Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue in binary encoding and decoding of array types in PostgreSQL
  wire protocol affecting the ``npgsql`` driver.

- As Microsoft Windows does not support sending signals, stop attempting to
  handle the ``USR2`` signal on Windows platforms as it pollutes the log with
  an unnecessary stacktrace.

- Fixed a performance regression which occurred in queries where a literal was
  compared against an array column of a different type. For example:
  ``SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 1 = ANY(int_arr_column)``
  The array column would have been converted to long although the literal on
  the left could have been converted to integer.

- Fixed an issue where the order of the relations in a ``FROM`` clause would
  expose fields between the relations. An error was thrown during execution of
  the statements.

- Fixed incorrect HTTP responses on the BLOB API of subsequent requests after
  an error response occurred, e.g. 404 Not Found.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``ANY`` to not work correctly on nested arrays.

- Fixed an issue that would cause a ``NullPointerException`` to be thrown when
  executing an ``EXPLAIN`` statement for a ``CROSS JOIN``.
