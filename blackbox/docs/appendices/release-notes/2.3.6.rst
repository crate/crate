Changelog
=========

Changes
-------

- Arrays can now contain mixed types if they're safely convertible. JSON
  libraries tend to encode values like ``[ 0.0, 1.2]`` as ``[ 0, 1.2 ]``, this
  caused an error because of the strict type match we enforced before.

Fixes
-----

- Do not allow renaming a table when connected to a read-only node.

- Fixed an issue that caused an error to be thrown when filtering on a
  partitioned table using a column which is a source column for a ``GENERATED``
  column which in turn is used for partitioning. E.g.::

    CREATE TABLE parted_t(
        t TIMESTAMP,
        day TIMESTAMP GENERATED ALWAYS AS date_trunc('day', t)
    ) PARTITIONED BY (day);

    SELECT * FROM parted_t WHERE t > 1522170000000;
