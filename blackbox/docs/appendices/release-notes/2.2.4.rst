Changelog

Fixes
-----

- Handle MultiPolygon shapes in ``WITHIN`` queries correctly instead of
  throwing an exception.

- Fixed an exception which occurred when using the ``_id`` system column in
  ``IN`` or ``ANY`` queries.

- The target table name used in ``ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO`` is now correctly
  validated.

- Fixed a regression that caused ``DELETE`` statements with a filter on
  ``PRIMARY KEY`` columns that don't match to fail instead of returning with a
  row count of 0.
