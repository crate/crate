How to Document a Feature
=========================

A single feature may have three types of documentation:

- Primary documentation
- Configuration documentation
- SQL syntax documentation

Primary documentation is located under one of the following sections:

- *CrateDB SQL*
- *Administration*
- *Plugins*

Primary documentation should cover:

- What the feature does
- How the feature can be used

Primary documentation should not include a full configuration settings
reference or a full SQL syntax reference. Instead, full references should be
added to *Configuration* or *SQL Syntax* sections.

When a feature is documented in more than one place, those locations should be
interlinked.

Enterprise features must be documented (with an explanatory note) alongside
standard features in the appropriate section of the documentation. The
*Enterprise Features* page must then be updated to link through to the primary
feature documentation.
