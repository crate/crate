====================================
Getting started with Crate on CoreOS
====================================

As a Linux distribution targetted at cloud and cluster based
environments, CoreOS is a perfect fit for a Crate cluster.

Pre-requisites
--------------

We assume you have a CoreOS cluster running and can access the
``fleetctl`` tool installed on your local system or on a node in the
CoreOS cluster.

Create the Crate Service
------------------------

Create a service file called *crate@.service* with the following
contents:

.. code-block:: bash

    [Unit]
    Description=crate
    After=docker.service
    Requires=docker.service

    [Service]
    TimeoutSec=180
    ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p /data/crate
    ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/docker pull crate/crate

    ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run \
        --name %p-%i \
        --publish 4200:4200 \
        --publish 4300:4300 \
        --volume /data/crate:/data \
        crate/crate \
        /crate/bin/crate \
        -Cnode.name=%p%i \

    ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop %p-%i
    ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker rm %p-%i

    [X-Fleet]
    X-Conflicts=%p@*.service

The ``TimeoutSec`` setting is important because pulling a docker image
for the first time takes some time and might cause a time out.

If you're familiar with systemd service files you'll notice that the
crate service file looks similar to a regular systemd service file. The
only difference is the ``[X-Fleet]`` section that ensures only one
service named *crate@x.service* is assigned per node.

Submit it to the cluster using fleet (assuming a 3 node cluster):

.. code-block:: bash

    fleetctl submit crate@{1,2,3}.service

Start the service across the cluster (assuming a 3 node cluster):

.. code-block:: bash

    fleetctl start crate@{1,2,3}.service

Once a crate service starts a folder named */data/crate* will be created
on each CoreOS node. The crate docker image is pulled and once finished
the container launches.

Check Status:

.. code-block:: bash

    fleetctl list-units
