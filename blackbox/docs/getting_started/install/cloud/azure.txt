Getting started with Crate on Microsoft Azure
=============================================

Microsoft Azure is the second largest and fastest growing provider of
Cloud Services in the world. It offers a wide variety of options
including Windows servers, containers, application images and much more.

Getting Crate working on Azure with Linux or Windows is a simple
process. You can use Azure's management console or CLI interface (`Learn
how to install
here <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/>`__).

Azure & Linux
-------------

Create a Resource Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Azure uses 'Resource Groups' to group together related services and
resources for easier management.

Create a resource group for the Crate cluster by selecting *Resource
groups* under the *new* left hand panel of the Azure portal.

Create a Network Security Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Crate uses two ports, one for inter-node communication (``4300``) and
one for it's http endpoint (``4200``), so access to these needs to be
opened.

Create a *New Security Group*, giving it a name and assigning it to the
'Resource Group' just created.

|

Find that security group in your resources list and open it's settings,
navigating to the *Inbound security rules* section.

|

Add a rule for each port:

Create a Virtual Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a cluster of Crate nodes on some cloud hosting providers,
Crate relies on unicast for inter-node communication.

The easiest way to get Unicast communication working with Azure is to
create a Virtual Network (*+ -> Networking -> Virtual Network*) so that
all the cluster nodes exist on the same IP range. Give the network a
name, a region and let Azure handle all the remaining settings by
clicking the next arrow on each screen.

Once the Virtual Network has been created, find it in your resources
list, open the edit screen and the *Subnets* setting. Add the security
group created earlier to the subnet.

Create Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next create virtual machines to act as your Crate nodes. In this
tutorial, I chose two low-specification Ubuntu 14.04 servers, but you
likely have your own preferred configurations.

Most importantly, make sure you select the Virtual Network created
earlier.

Install Crate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note that these instructions should be followed on each VM in your
cluster.*

To Install Crate, ssh into your VMs and follow `the standard process for
Linux installation </docs/install/local/linux/>`__, this will
automatically start an instance of Crate, which we will need to restart
after the next step.

Configure Crate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note that these instructions should be followed on each VM in your
cluster.*

To set the Unicast hosts for the Crate cluster we change the default
configuration file at */etc/crate/crate.yml*.

Uncomment / add these lines:

.. code-block:: yaml

    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts:
          - internal-ip-address:4300
          - internal-ip-address:4300

Note You might want to try DNS based discovery for inter-node
communication, `find more
details </docs/reference/configuration.html#discovery-via-dns>`__ in our
documentation.

Uncomment and set the cluster name

.. code-block:: yaml

    cluster.name: crate

Restart Crate ``service crate restart``.

Azure & Windows
---------------

Initial Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a Resource Group, Network security group and virtual network,
follow the same steps as for Azure and Linux.

Create Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar steps to creating Virtual Machines for Azure and Linux, but
create the VM based on the 'Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter' image.

Install Crate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note that these instructions should be followed on each VM in your
cluster.*

To install Crate on Windows Server, you will need a `Java JDK
installed <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>`__.
Ensure that the ``JAVA*HOME`` environment variable is set.

|

Next `download the Crate Tarball </docs/install/local/tarball/>`__,
expand it and move to a convenient location.

Configure Crate and Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note that these instructions need to be followed on each VM in your
cluster.*

Edit the *config/crate.yml* configuration file in the expanded directory
to make the same changes noted above in running Crate on Azure & Linux.

We need to allow the ports Crate uses through the Windows Firewall

Start crate by running ``bin/crate``.
