Getting started with Crate on Amazon Web Services
=================================================

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the worlds most popular cloud hosting
provider with 1000s of options for platforms, applications and
infrastructure.

An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a pre-configured virtual appliance
optimized for a particular use. With the Crate AMI, this includes
dependencies, optimization and configuration to get Crate running as
quickly and efficiently as possible. Using the AMI is our recommended
method for running Crate clusters on AWS.

With the AWS Command Line Interface
-----------------------------------

You can find the Crate AMI via the command line interface, in the format
``crate-<VERSION>-<REV>-<BASE_AMI>``.

For example, to find all Crate AMIs available:

.. code-block:: bash

    aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=name,Values=crate-*"

.. image:: aws-terminal-output.png
   :alt: Terminal Output

If you are looking for particular Crate version, you can be more
precise:

.. code-block:: bash

    aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=name,Values=crate-0.51.1-1-amzn-*"

To run instances based on your AMI of choice, run the following command
with the ``image-id`` of the Crate version you wish to run, the name of
a security group that allows the ports Crate requires (4200, 4300) and
if you want to use the EC2 API for inter-node discovery, a link to a
``user-data`` script.

.. code-block:: bash

    aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-96702de1 --count x --instance-type m3.medium --user-data $(base64 user-data.sh) --key-name keyname --security-groups groupname

With the AWS Web Interface
--------------------------

To use the AWS website to launch an instance, click the blue 'Launch
Instance' button and find the available Crate AMIs under the *Community
AMIs* section.

Click the 'select' button on the AMI you wish to use and set the
instance configuration. The most important options here are the number
of instances you require and selecting a security group that opens ports
4200 and 4300.

The User Data file
------------------

Amongst other configuration options, the User Data file is primarily
used for setting your AWS credentials to make use of the EC2 API for
inter-node discovery.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=''
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=''
    " >> /etc/sysconfig/crate
