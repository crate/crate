====================================
Getting started with Crate on Packet
====================================

`Packet <https://www.packet.net>`__ is a bare metal provider built for
the next generation of production workloads. Their emphasis on
API-centered cloud deployment, fast networking, and container-ready
hardware make them a good choice for developers and production workloads
- and perfect for Crate clusters!

Create your Crate Project
-------------------------

Packet organizes machines as projects which bundle together several
types of deployments:

-  Servers
-  Storage
-  Network

To get started, create a new project called 'Crate' (or any name of your
choosing) and deploy some machines. For production use, we recommend
`Type-1 <https://www.packet.net/bare-metal/>`__ servers, which are
powerful enough to handle medium to large workloads.

Start by choosing an operating system for your deployment. After the
server is ready, Packet's IaaS machines behave just like any other
machine. Make sure to deploy an SSH key to access the server and after
the machines are ready, SSH access can be obtained by logging in with
``ssh root@<public-ip>``. From there it's just as any other Linux
machine and there are several ways to install Crate on the machine(s).

Linux. </docs/install/local/linux/>`__.
