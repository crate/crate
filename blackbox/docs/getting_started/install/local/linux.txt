================
Install on Linux
================

Crate maintains official packages for Arch Linux, Debian, RedHat
Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. We recommend you use our 1-step installer
that will configure the appropriate package repository and install Crate
for you.

.. code-block:: bash

    bash -c "$(curl -L install.crate.io)"

If you like to do things manually, here's how.

Arch Linux
----------

Crate publishes build files to `Arch Linux
AUR <https://aur4.archlinux.org/packages/crate/>`__. If you have any
problems installing packages from the AUR, full instructions are
available on the Arch Linux
`Wiki <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_User_Guidelines>`__).
Make sure you have installed ``build base-devel`` with the
``pacman -S --needed base-devel`` command.

Download the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir ~/builds
    cd ~/builds
    curl -O https://aur4.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/crate.tar.gz
    tar xzvf crate.tar.gz

Build and install the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    cd crate
    makepkg -si

Start Crate
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl enable crate.service
    sudo systemctl start crate.service

Debian
------

We provide Debian packages for the Wheezy (7.x) and Jessie (8.x)
distributions. To install Crate from our repository requires a couple of
steps.

The first two steps are identical for both distributions.

1. Install https support for apt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

2. Download and install GPG key:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/DEB-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo apt-key add DEB-GPG-KEY-crate

Debian Wheezy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3. Install Java 8
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wheezy does not officially ship with Java 8, so you have to install it
via a 3rd party repository, e.g. provided by **webupd8team**:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    echo "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EEA14886
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

4. Add Crate repository to sources list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, add the Crate repository to */etc/apt/sources.list*.

Stable Releases
'''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: bash

    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ wheezy main
    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ wheezy main

Testing Releases
''''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: bash

    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ wheezy main
    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ wheezy main

5. Fetch new sources and install Crate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate

Verify that you have installed Crate and it's running:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo service crate status

Debian Jessie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3. Add Backports and Crate repository to sources list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, add the Crate repository to */etc/apt/sources.list*. Also add the
``jessie-backports`` repository to sources so that the Java 8 dependency
can be resolved automatically.

.. code-block:: bash

    deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main

Stable Releases
'''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: bash

    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ jessie main
    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ jessie main

Testing Releases
''''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: bash

    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ jessie main
    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ jessie main

4. Fetch new sources and install Crate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate
    sudo systemctl enable crate

Verify that you have installed Crate and it's running:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl status crate

Red Hat
-------

The Crate Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based
releases, supporting Linux Distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux
6, CentOS 6 and Scientific Linux 6.

RHEL6
~~~~~

Enable the Crate YUM repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All Crate packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, you must
install the public key and then install the *.rpm* containing the YUM
repository definition.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/6/x86_64/crate-release-6.5-1.noarch.rpm

Testing and Unstable Releases
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Crate Testing repository is disabled by default, it contains
development builds and is frequently updated. The packages are waiting
for feedback from testers on functionality and stability. Packages in
this repository will change during development, so you should disable it
on production systems. If you want to enable the Testing repo on your
server, set ``enabled=1`` in */etc/yum.repos.d/crate.repo*.

Install Crate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    yum install crate

Start Crate
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo service crate start

RHEL7
~~~~~

The Crate Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based
releases. It's supported on Linux Distributions such as RedHat
Enterprise Linux 7, CentOS 7, or Scientific Linux 7.

Enable the Crate YUM repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All Crate packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, you must
install the public key and then you can install the *.rpm* containing
the YUM repository definition.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/7/noarch/crate-release-7.0-1.noarch.rpm

Install Crate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo yum install crate

Start Crate
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl start crate.service

Ubuntu
------

We build packages for the Ubuntu versions Yakkety Yak (16.10), Xenial
Xerus (16.04), Trusty Tahr (14.04) and Precise Pangolin (12.04). They
are available on our `Launchpad page <https://launchpad.net/~crate>`__.
Adding the repository and installing Crate requires the following
commands:

Install Java 8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 do not officially ship with Java 8, so you have
to `install it via a 3rd party
repository <https://crate.io/docs/install/local/linux/#debian-wheezy>`__

Install Crate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a PPA repository requires ``python-software-properties`` to be
installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties

Ubuntu >= **16.x** additionally requires ``software-properties-common``:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

Then it's possible to add the Crate repository using
``add-apt-repository`` and install Crate:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/stable
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate

Start Crate
~~~~~~~~~~~

Crate should have been started automatically by upstart and you can stop
or restart it with:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo service crate stop
    sudo service crate restart

Testing and Unstable Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Crate Testing repository is disabled by default, it contains
development builds and is frequently updated. The packages are waiting
for feedback from testers on functionality and stability. Packages in
this repository will change during development, so it should be disabled
on production systems. If you want to enable the Testing repo on your
server. To enable the Testing Repository on your machine add the PPA:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/testing
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate

**Important:** Crate requires the latest Java 8 (at least u20 or
higher). To run Crate on Ubuntu releases older than 14.10 you would need
to install Java 8 from the `Ubuntu
Backports <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports>`__
repository.

Setting Environment Variables
-----------------------------

On Ubuntu, Debian and RHEL systems the Crate startup script sources
environment variables, such as ``CRATE_HEAP_SIZE`` or
``CRATE_JAVA_OPTS`` that you define in */etc/default/crate*.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    # Heap Size (defaults to 256m min, 1g max)
    CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g

    # Maximum number of open files, defaults to 65535.
    # MAX_OPEN_FILES=65535

    # Maximum locked memory size. Set to "unlimited" if you use the
    # bootstrap.mlockall option in crate.yml. You must also set
    # CRATE_HEAP_SIZE.
    MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited

    # Additional Java OPTS
    # CRATE_JAVA_OPTS=

    # Force the JVM to use IPv4 stack
    CRATE_USE_IPV4=true
