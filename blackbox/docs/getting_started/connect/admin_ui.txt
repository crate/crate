Manage your Cluster with the Crate Admin UI
===========================================

Crate ships with an Admin UI that provides an overview of your cluster,
nodes, tables and much more.

Connect to Cluster
------------------

To Connect to Crate Cluster, open the following url:

*http://SERVER\_IP:4200/admin*

``SERVER_IP`` is the publicly accessible IP address of any node in the
Crate cluster.

Admin UI Features
-----------------

Overview Bar and Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: status_bar.png

At the top of the browser window is overview information about the
cluster that shows, from left to right:

-  The name of the cluster, find out `how to change its value our
   configuration
   documentation <https://crate.io/docs/reference/configuration.html#cluster-name>`__
-  The version of Crate that the cluster is running.
-  The health of the data in the cluster. Green indicates that all data
   is replicated and available, yellow that there are unreplicated
   records and red that data is unavailable.
-  Potential configuration problems and recommendations for the cluster.
-  Average cluster load over the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
-  Settings menu that allows you to update the language settings and
   provides a link to the CrateDB documentation and the latest CrateDB
   news.

The overview tab displays similar information to the bar but with more
details on data availability, cluster load and problems. On the left
side of the window there are five further tabs.
