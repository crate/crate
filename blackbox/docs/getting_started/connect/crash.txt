==================
Crash, Crate's CLI
==================

Crash is Crate's shell for interacting with clusters.

The Crash shell can be used from within a node that is part of a cluster
or on another machine to connect to a remote cluster.

To launch Crash:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./bin/crash

Your command prompt will then switch to a ``cr>`` prompt. Connect to a
cluster using the URL and the Crate port (*4200*):

.. code-block:: bash

    cr> \connect 127.0.0.1:4200;

You can then use Crash to issue SQL queries and other commands.
