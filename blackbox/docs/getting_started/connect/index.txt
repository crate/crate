====================
Connect to a Cluster
====================

To Connect to your Crate Cluster, you will need to know the IP or DNS
address of one node in the cluster and Crate uses port *4200* for HTTP
transport. You then have several options available, our `Admin
UI <admin_ui/>`__, our `CLI tool <crash/>`__ (Crash) and a `REST
API </docs/getting-started/clients/rest/>`__.
