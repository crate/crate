   :local:

Basics
======

.. _cluster.name:

**cluster.name**
  | *Default:*    ``crate``
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  The name of the CrateDB cluster the node should join to.

**node.name**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  The name of the node. If no name is configured a random one will be
  generated.

  .. NOTE::

      Node names must be unique in a CrateDB cluster.

**node.max_local_storage_nodes**
  | *Default:*    ``1``
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  Defines how many nodes are allowed to be started on the same machine using
  the same configured data path defined via `path.data`_.

Node Types
==========

CrateDB supports different kinds of nodes.

The following settings can be used to differentiate nodes upon startup:

**node.master**
  | *Default:* ``true``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Whether or not this node is able to get elected as *master* node in the
  cluster.

**node.data**
  | *Default:* ``true``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Whether or not this node will store data.

Using different combinations of these two settings, you can create four
different types of node. Each type of node is differentiate by what types of
load it will handle.

The four types of node possible are:

+---------------+----------------------------+------------------------------+
|               | **Master**                 | **No Master**                |
+---------------+----------------------------+------------------------------+
| **Data**      | Can handle all loads.      | Handles request handling and |
|               |                            | query execution loads.       |
+---------------+----------------------------+------------------------------+
| **No Data**   | Can handle cluster         | Handles request handling     |
|               | management loads.          | loads.                       |
+---------------+----------------------------+------------------------------+

Nodes marked as ``node.master`` will only handle cluster management loads if
they are elected as the cluster master. All other loads are shared equally.

Read-only node
==============

**node.sql.read_only**
  | *Default:* ``false``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  If set to ``true``, the node will only allow SQL statements which are
  resulting in read operations.

.. _conf_hosts:

Hosts
=====

.. _network.host:

**network.host**
  | *Default:*   ``_local_``
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  The IP address CrateDB will bind itself to. This setting sets both the
  `network.bind_host`_ and `network.publish_host`_ values.

.. _network.bind_host:

**network.bind_host**
  | *Default:*   ``_local_``
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  This setting determines to which address CrateDB should bind itself to.

.. _network.publish_host:

**network.publish_host**
  | *Default:*   ``_local_``
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  This setting is used by a CrateDB node to publish its own address to the rest
  of the cluster.

.. TIP::

    Apart from IPv4 and IPv6 addresses there are some special values that can
    be used for all above settings:

    =========================  =================================================
    ``_local_``                Any loopback addresses on the system, for example
                               ``127.0.0.1``.
    ``_site_``                 Any site-local addresses on the system, for
                               example ``192.168.0.1``.
    ``_global_``               Any globally-scoped addresses on the system, for
                               example ``8.8.8.8``.
    ``_[INTERFACE]_``          Addresses of a network interface, for example
                               ``_en0_``.
    =========================  =================================================

.. _conf_ports:

Ports
=====

.. _http.port:

**http.port**
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  This defines the TCP port range to which the CrateDB HTTP service will be
  bound to. It defaults to ``4200-4300``. Always the first free port in this
  range is used. If this is set to an integer value it is considered as an
  explicit single port.

  The HTTP protocol is used for the REST endpoint which is used by all clients
  except the Java client.

.. _http.publish_port:

**http.publish_port**
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  The port HTTP clients should use to communicate with the node. It is
  necessary to define this setting if the bound HTTP port (``http.port``) of
  the node is not directly reachable from outside, e.g. running it behind a
  firewall or inside a Docker container.

.. _transport.tcp.port:

**transport.tcp.port**
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  This defines the TCP port range to which the CrateDB transport service will
  be bound to. It defaults to ``4300-4400``. Always the first free port in this
  range is used. If this is set to an integer value it is considered as an
  explicit single port.

  The transport protocol is used for internal node-to-node communication.

.. _transport.publish_port:

**transport.publish_port**
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  The port that the node publishes to the cluster for its own discovery. It is
  necessary to define this setting when the bound tranport port
  (``transport.tcp.port``) of the node is not directly reachable from outside,
  e.g. running it behind a firewall or inside a Docker container.

.. _psql_port:

**psql.port**
  | *Runtime:*   ``no``

  This defines the TCP port range to which the CrateDB Postgres service will be
  bound to. It defaults to ``5432-5532``. Always the first free port in this
  range is used. If this is set to an integer value it is considered as an
  explicit single port.

Paths
=====

**path.conf**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Filesystem path to the directory containing the configuration files
  ``crate.yml`` and ``log4j2.properties``.

.. _path.data:

**path.data**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Filesystem path to the directory where this CrateDB node stores its data
  (table data and cluster metadata).

  Multiple paths can be set by using a comma separated list and each of these
  paths will hold full shards (instead of striping data across them). In case
  CrateDB finds striped shards at the provided locations (from CrateDB
  <0.55.0), these shards will be migrated automatically on startup.

**path.logs**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Filesystem path to a directory where log files should be stored.

  Can be used as a variable inside ``log4j2.properties``.

  For example:

  .. code-block::
     yaml

     appender:
       file:
         file: ${path.logs}/${cluster.name}.log

.. _conf-path-repo:

**path.repo**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  A list of filesystem or UNC paths where repositories of type
  :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-fs` may be stored.

  Without this setting a CrateDB user could write snapshot files to any
  directory that is writable by the CrateDB process. To safeguard against this
  security issue, the possible paths have to be whitelisted here.

  See also :ref:`location <ref-create-repository-types-fs-location>` setting of
  repository type ``fs``.

Plugins
=======

**plugin.mandatory**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  A list of plugins that are required for a node to startup.

  If any plugin listed here is missing, the CrateDB node will fail to start.

CPU
===

**processors**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  The number of available processes is automatically guessed, and so most of
  the time you will not need to configure this explicitly.

  However, in some situations, such as when CrateDB is being run on top of
  Docker, the number of processors may be guessed incorrectly. If this happens,
  you can manually configure the number of processors using this setting.

  You can also use this setting to manually constrain the number of CPUs made
  available to CrateDB. You might want to do this if you're running CrateDB in
  a multitenant setup (i.e. more than one CrateDB node running on the same
  hardware).

Memory
======

**bootstrap.memory_lock**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``
  | *Default:* ``false``

  CrateDB performs poorly when the JVM starts swapping: you should ensure that
  it *never* swaps. If set to ``true``, CrateDB will use the ``mlockall``
  system call on startup to ensure that the memory pages of the CrateDB process
  are locked into RAM.

Garbage Collection
==================

CrateDB logs if JVM garbage collection on different memory pools takes too
long. The following settings can be used to adjust these timeouts:

**monitor.jvm.gc.collector.young.warn**
  | *Default:* ``1000ms``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  CrateDB will log a warning message if it takes more than the configured
  timespan to collect the *Eden Space* (heap).

**monitor.jvm.gc.collector.young.info**
  | *Default:* ``700ms``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  CrateDB will log an info message if it takes more than the configured
  timespan to collect the *Eden Space* (heap).

**monitor.jvm.gc.collector.young.debug**
  | *Default:* ``400ms``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  CrateDB will log a debug message if it takes more than the configured
  timespan to collect the *Eden Space* (heap).

**monitor.jvm.gc.collector.old.warn**
  | *Default:* ``10000ms``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  CrateDB will log a warning message if it takes more than the configured
  timespan to collect the *Old Gen* / *Tenured Gen* (heap).

**monitor.jvm.gc.collector.old.info**
  | *Default:* ``5000ms``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  CrateDB will log an info message if it takes more than the configured
  timespan to collect the *Old Gen* / *Tenured Gen* (heap).

**monitor.jvm.gc.collector.old.debug**
  | *Default:* ``2000ms``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  CrateDB will log a debug message if it takes more than the configured
  timespan to collect the *Old Gen* / *Tenured Gen* (heap).

Authentication
==============

.. NOTE::

    Authentication is an :ref:`enterprise feature <enterprise_features>`.

.. _host_based_auth:

Trust Authentication
--------------------

**auth.trust.http_default_user**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``
  | *Default:* ``crate``

  The default user that should be used for authentication when clients connect
  to CrateDB via HTTP protocol and they do not specify a user via the
  ``Authorization`` request header.

Host Based Authentication
-------------------------

Authentication settings (``auth.host_based.*``) are node settings, which means
that their values apply only to the node where they are applied and different
nodes may have different authentication settings.

**auth.host_based.enabled**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``
  | *Default:* ``false``

  Setting to enable or disable Host Based Authentication (HBA). It is disabled
  by default.

HBA Entries
...........

The ``auth.host_based.config.`` setting is a group setting that can have zero,
one or multiple groups that are defined by their group key (``${order}``) and
their fields (``user``, ``address``, ``method``, ``protocol``, ``ssl``).

**${order}:**
  | An identifier that is used as a natural order key when looking up the host
  | based configuration entries. For example, an order key of ``a`` will be
  | looked up before an order key of ``b``. This key guarantees that the entry
  | lookup order will remain independent from the insertion order of the
  | entries.

The :ref:`admin_hba` setting is a list of predicates that users can specify to
restrict or allow access to CrateDB.

The meaning of the fields of the are as follows:

**auth.host_based.config.${order}.user**
  | *Runtime:*  ``no``

  | Specifies an existing CrateDB username, only ``crate`` user (superuser) is
  | available. If no user is specified in the entry, then all existing users
  | can have access.

**auth.host_based.config.${order}.address**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  | The client machine addresses that the client matches, and which are allowed
  | to authenticate. This field may contain an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address or
  | an IPv4 CIDR mask. For example: ``127.0.0.1`` or ``127.0.0.1/32``. It also
  | may contain the special ``_local_`` notation which will match both IPv4 and
  | IPv6 connections from localhost. If no address is specified in the entry,
  | then access to CrateDB is open for all hosts.

**auth.host_based.config.${order}.method**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  | The authentication method to use when a connection matches this entry.
  | Valid values are ``trust``, ``cert``, and ``password``. If no method is
  | specified, the ``trust`` method is used by default.
  | See :ref:`auth_trust`, :ref:`auth_cert` and :ref:`auth_password` for more
  | information about these methods.

**auth.host_based.config.${order}.protocol**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  | Specifies the protocol for which the authentication entry should be used.
  | If no protocol is specified, then this entry will be valid for all
  | protocols that rely on host based authentication see :ref:`auth_trust`).

**auth.host_based.config.${order}.ssl**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``
  | *Default:* ``optional``

  | Specifies whether the client must use SSL/TLS to connect to the cluster.
  | If set to ``on`` then the client must be connected through SSL/TLS
  | otherwise is not authenticated. If set to ``off`` then the client must
  | *not* be connected via SSL/TLS otherwise is not authenticated. Finally
  | ``optional``, which is the value when the option is completely skipped,
  | means that the client can be authenticated regardless of SSL/TLS is used
  | or not.

  .. NOTE::

      **auth.host_based.config.${order}.ssl** is available only for ``pg``
      protocol.

**Example of config groups:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    auth.host_based.config:
      entry_a:
        user: crate
        address: 127.16.0.0/16
      entry_b:
        method: trust
      entry_3:
        user: crate
        address: 172.16.0.0/16
        method: trust
        protocol: pg
        ssl: on


.. _ssl_config:

Secured Communications (SSL/TLS)
================================

Secured communications via SSL allows you to encrypt traffic between CrateDB
nodes and clients connecting to them. Connections are secured using Transport
Layer Security (TLS).

.. NOTE::

    SSL is an :ref:`enterprise feature <enterprise_features>`.

**ssl.http.enabled**
  | *Runtime:*  ``no``
  | *Default:* ``false``

  Set this to true to enable secure communication between the CrateDB node
  and the client through SSL via the HTTPS protocol.

**ssl.psql.enabled**
  | *Runtime:*  ``no``
  | *Default:* ``false``

  Set this to true to enable secure communication between the CrateDB node
  and the client through SSL via the PostgreSQL wire protocol.

.. _ssl_ingestion_mqtt_enabled:

**ssl.ingestion.mqtt.enabled**
  | *Runtime:*  ``no``
  | *Default:* ``false``

  Set this to true to enable secure communication between the CrateDB node and
  the client through SSL via the MQTT protocol.

**ssl.keystore_filepath**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  The full path to the node keystore file.

**ssl.keystore_password**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  The password used to decrypt the keystore file defined with
  ``ssl.keystore_filepath``.

**ssl.keystore_key_password**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  The password entered at the end of the ``keytool -genkey command``.

.. NOTE::

    Optionally trusted CA certificates can be stored separately from the
    node's keystore into a truststore for CA certificates.

**ssl.truststore_filepath**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  The full path to the node truststore file. If not defined, then only a
  keystore will be used.

**ssl.truststore_password**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  The password used to decrypt the truststore file defined with
  ``ssl.truststore_filepath``.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
====================================

Many browsers support the `same-origin policy`_ which requires web applications
to explicitly allow requests across origins. The `cross-origin resource
sharing`_ settings in CrateDB allow for configuring these.

**http.cors.enabled**
  | *Default:* ``false``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Enable or disable `cross-origin resource sharing`_.

**http.cors.allow-origin**
  | *Default:* ``<empty>``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Define allowed origins of a request. ``*`` allows *any* origin (which can be
  a substantial security risk) and by prepending a ``/`` the string will be
  treated as a regular expression. For example ``/https?:\/\/crate.io/`` will
  allow requests from ``http://crate.io`` and ``https://crate.io``. This
  setting disallows any origin by default.

**http.cors.max-age**
  | *Default:* ``1728000`` (20 days)
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Max cache age of a preflight request in seconds.

**http.cors.allow-methods**
  | *Default:* ``OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Allowed HTTP methods.

**http.cors.allow-headers**
  | *Default:* ``X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Content-Length``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Allowed HTTP headers.

**http.cors.allow-credentials**
  | *Default:* ``false``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Add the ``Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`` header to responses.

.. _`same-origin policy`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy
.. _`cross-origin resource sharing`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS

Blobs
=====

**blobs.path**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  Path to a filesystem directory where to store blob data allocated for this
  node.

  By default blobs will be stored under the same path as normal data. A
  relative path value is interpreted as relative to ``CRATE_HOME``.

.. _ref-configuration-repositories:

Repositories
============

Repositories are used to :ref:`backup <snapshot-restore>` a CrateDB cluster.

**repositories.url.allowed_urls**
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  This setting only applies to repositories of type
  :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-url`.

  With this setting a list of urls can be specified which are allowed to be
  used if a repository of type ``url`` is created.

  Wildcards are supported in the host, path, query and fragment parts.

  This setting is a security measure to prevent access to arbitrary resources.

  In addition, the supported protocols can be restricted using the
  :ref:`repositories.url.supported_protocols
  <conf-repositories-url-supported-protocols>` setting.

.. _conf-repositories-url-supported-protocols:

**repositories.url.supported_protocols**
  | *Default:* ``http``, ``https``, ``ftp``, ``file`` and ``jar``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  A list of protocols that are supported by repositories of type
  :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-url`.

  The ``jar`` protocol is used to access the contents of jar files. For more
  info, see the java `JarURLConnection documentation`_.

See also the :ref:`path.repo <conf-path-repo>` Setting.

.. _`JarURLConnection documentation`: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/JarURLConnection.html

Queries
=======

.. _conf-indices-query-bool.max_clause_count:

**indices.query.bool.max_clause_count**
  | *Default:* ``8192``
  | *Runtime:* ``no``

  This setting defines the maximum number of elements an array can have so
  that the ``!= ANY()``, ``LIKE ANY()`` and the ``NOT LIKE ANY()`` operators
  can be applied on it.

  .. NOTE::

    Increasing this value to a large number (e.g. 10M) and applying  those
    ``ANY`` operators on arrays of that length can lead to heavy memory,
    consumption which could cause nodes to crash with OutOfMemory exceptions.

.. _conf-node-lang-js:

Javascript Language
===================

**lang.js.enabled**
  | *Default:*  ``false``
  | *Runtime:*  ``no``

  Setting to enable the Javascript language. As The Javascript language is an
  experimental feature and is not securely sandboxed its disabled by default.

  .. NOTE::

      This is an :ref:`enterprise feature <enterprise_features>`.

.. _conf-node-attributes:

Custom Attributes
=================

The ``node.attr`` namespace is a bag of custom attributes.

You can create any attribute you want under this namespace, like
``node.attr.key: value``. These attributes use the ``node.attr`` namespace to
distinguish them from core node attribute like ``node.name``.

Custom attributes are not validated by CrateDB, unlike core node attributes.

Custom attributes can, however, be :ref:`used to control shard allocation
<conf-routing-allocation-awareness>`.


Ingestion Framework
===================

.. _ingest_mqtt_config:

MQTT
----

Settings for the :ref:`ingest_mqtt`.

.. NOTE::

   The MQTT ingestion source an
   :ref:`enterprise feature <enterprise_features>`.

**ingestion.mqtt.enabled**
  | *Default:*   ``false``
  | *Runtime:*  ``no``

  Enables the MQTT_ ingestion source on this node.

.. _ingestion_mqtt_port:

**ingestion.mqtt.port**
  | *Default:*   ``1883``
  | *Runtime:*  ``no``

  TCP port on which the endpoint is exposed.

  Can either be a number, or a string defining a port range. The first free
  port of this range is used.

**ingestion.mqtt.timeout**
  | *Default:*   ``10s``
  | *Runtime:*  ``no``

  The default keep-alive timeout for establised connections.

  This timeout is used if the client does not specify a ``keepAlive`` option
  when sending the ``CONNECT`` message.

.. _conf-node-enterprise-license:

Enterprise License
==================

**license.enterprise**
  | *Default:*  ``true``
  | *Runtime:*  ``no``

  Setting this to ``false`` disables the `Enterprise Edition`_ of CrateDB.

.. _`Enterprise Edition`: https://crate.io/enterprise-edition/
