Feature List
============

When you first download CrateDB, the :ref:`license.enterprise
<conf-node-enterprise-license>` setting is set to ``true`` and the following
enterprise features are enabled:

- :ref:`administration_user_management`: manage multiple database users
- :ref:`administration-privileges`: configure user privileges
- :ref:`admin_auth`: manage your database with authentication, and
  more
- System information functions: :ref:`CURRENT_USER <current_user>`,
  :ref:`USER <user>`, :ref:`SESSION_USER <session_user>`
- :ref:`Support for JavaScript in UDF <udf_lang_js>`: write user-defined
  functions in JavaScript
- :ref:`jmx_monitoring`: monitor your query stats with JMX
- :ref:`ingest_mqtt`: ingest data using MQTT_ without any 3rd party tools
- :ref:`aggregation-hll-distinct`: distinct count aggregation using the
  `HyperLoglog++`_ algorithm
- `The CrateDB admin UI`_: `shards browser`_, `monitoring overview`_,
  `privileges browser`_

Trial
=====

You may evaluate CrateDB during a 30-day trial period, after which you must
`request an enterprise license`_ and configure CrateDB using the :ref:`SET
LICENSE <ref-set-license>` statement.

.. NOTE::

    When the trial period ends, CrateDB functionality will be limited to
    executing the following statements:

    - :ref:`SET LICENSE <ref-set-license>`

    - :ref:`SELECT <sql_reference_select>` (:ref:`information_schema
      <information_schema>` and :ref:`sys <system-information>` schemas only)

If you wish to continue using CrateDB without an enterprise license after the
trial period ends you must set :ref:`license.enterprise
<conf-node-enterprise-license>` to ``false``. This activates the `community
edition`_ of CrateDB and restores all functionality except for the enterprise
features.
