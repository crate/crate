Enterprise Features
===================

CrateDB provides an `Enterprise Edition`_, which is activated by default.
The source code remains open, but if you want to use one of the enterprise
features in production you need to purchase a `enterprise license`_.

**The current enterprise features are:**

* `JMX Monitoring`_: Query stats exposed via JMX.
* `Database Administration`_: Managing your Database with Authentication and 
  more.
* `Support for JavaScript in UDF`_: User Defined Functions can be written in
  JavaScript.
