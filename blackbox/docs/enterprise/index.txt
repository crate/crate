Enterprise Features
===================

CrateDB provides an `Enterprise Edition`_, which is activated by default. The
source code remains open, but if you want to use one of the enterprise features
in production you need to purchase a `enterprise license`_.

Current features:

- :ref:`administration_user_management`: manage multiple database users
- :ref:`administration-privileges`: configure user privileges
- :doc:`/administration/index`: manage your database with authentication, and
  more
- System information functions: :ref:`CURRENT_USER <current_user>`,
  :ref:`USER <user>`, :ref:`SESSION_USER <session_user>`
- :ref:`Support for JavaScript in UDF <udf_lang_js>`: write user-defined
  functions in JavaScript
- :ref:`jmx_monitoring_plugin`: monitor your query stats with JMX
