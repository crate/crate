Editions
========

When you download the pre-build CrateDB packages from the Crate.io website, you
are downloading the standard edition of CrateDB. This edition comes with
*Enterprise Features*. If you want to run CrateDB on more than three nodes, you
must acquire an *Enterprise License*.

When you build CrateDB from source, you get the CrateDB Community Edition
which does not come with enterprise features and does not have any node
limitations.

    overview `product comparison`_.

    For more detailed licensing information, please contact us directly or
    consult the information in the `NOTICE`_ and `LICENSE`_ files.

.. _node-limitations:

Node Limitation
---------------

To make full use of CrateDB, you must `acquire an Enterprise License`_. Unless and
until you do that, CrateDB is limited to running on no more than three nodes.

.. NOTE::

    An Enterprise License will be provided at no cost for use by non-profit and
    educational organizations. Limitations apply. Please `contact us`_.

.. CAUTION::

    If you exceed the three nodes limitation your cluster will stop accepting
    queries and CrateDB functionality will be limited to:

     - :ref:`SET LICENSE <ref-set-license>`

     - :ref:`SELECT <sql_reference_select>` (:ref:`information_schema
       <information_schema>` and :ref:`sys <system-information>` schemas only)

     - :ref:`alter_cluster_decommission`

    To restore functionality, you must :ref:`SET LICENSE <ref-set-license>` or
    scale down to three or fewer nodes.

If you wish to use CrateDB without an Enterprise License and without the three
node limitation, you can switch to the :ref:`community-edition`.

.. _community-edition:

CrateDB Community Edition
=========================

The CrateDB *Community Edition* (CrateDB CE) does not include any
:ref:`enterprise-features` but can be run on as many nodes as you wish.

CrateDB CE must be built from source, like so:

.. code-block:: console

   sh$ git clone https://github.com/crate/crate
   sh$ cd crate
   sh$ git submodule update --init
   sh$ git checkout <TAG>
   sh$ ./gradlew clean communityEditionDistTar

Here, replace ``<TAG>`` with the commit hash of the Git tag that corresponds to
the `release`_ you wish to use.

When the ``gradlew`` command successfully completes, the relevant CrateDB CE
release tarball will be located in the ``app/build/distributions`` directory.
