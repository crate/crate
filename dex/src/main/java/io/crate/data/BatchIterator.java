/**
 * An iterator used to navigate over data organized in batches. Though not required most
 * implementations already hold an initial batch of data ready for use and further data can be loaded asynchronously
 * via the {@link #loadNextBatch()} method.
 *
 * The loaded data can be accessed by moving the iterator via the movement methods {@link #moveNext()} and
 * {@link #moveToStart()} and then using the {@link Columns} object returned by {@link #rowData()} to access the data
 * at the current position.
 *
 * Once all loaded data has been consumed more data can be loaded with {@link #loadNextBatch()} unless {@link
 * #allLoaded()} is true in which case the iterator is exhausted.
 *
 * A BatchIterator starts either *before* the first row or in an unloaded state.
 * This means a consumer can consume a BatchIterator like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     while (it.moveNext()) {
 *         // do something with the row
 *     }
 *     if (it.allLoaded()) {
 *          // iterator is exhausted
 *     } else {
 *         it.loadNextBatch().whenComplete((r, t) -> {
 *             // continue consumption
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * Thread-safety notes:
 *
 * Concurrent usage of a BatchIterator is not supported.
