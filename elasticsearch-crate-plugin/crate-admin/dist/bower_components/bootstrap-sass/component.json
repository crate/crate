You can run `sass --watch lib/bootstrap.scss:bootstrap-2.3.2.css`\n\n\n\n## Versioning\n\nFor transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit [http://semver.org/](http://semver.org/).\n\n\n\n## Bug tracker\n\nHave a bug or a feature request? [Please open a new issue](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues). Before opening any issue, please search for existing issues and read the [Issue Guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines), written by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas/).\n\n\n\n## Community\n\nKeep track of development and community news.\n\n* Follow [@twbootstrap on Twitter](http://twitter.com/twbootstrap).\n* Read and subscribe to the [The Official Twitter Bootstrap Blog](http://blog.getbootstrap.com).\n* Have a question that's not a feature request or bug report? [Ask on the mailing list.](http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-bootstrap)\n* Chat with fellow Bootstrappers in IRC. On the `irc.freenode.net` server, in the `##twitter-bootstrap` channel.\n\n\n\n## SASS: Developers\n\nWe have included a Rakefile with convenience methods for working with the SASS Bootstrap library.\n\n+ **build** - `rake build`\nThis will run the less compiler on the bootstrap lib and regenerate the docs dir.\nThe lessc compiler is required for this command to run.\n\n+ **watch** - `rake watch`\nThis is a convenience method for watching your Sass files and automatically building them whenever you save.\n\n\n\n## Compiling CSS and JavaScript\n\nBootstrap includes a [makefile](Makefile) with convenient methods for working with the framework. Before getting started, be sure to install [the necessary local dependencies](package.json):\n\n```\n$ npm install\n```\n\nWhen completed, you'll be able to run the various make commands provided:\n\n#### build - `make`\nRuns the recess compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs. Requires recess and uglify-js.\n\n#### test - `make test`\nRuns jshint and qunit tests headlessly in [phantomjs](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/) (used for ci). Depends on having phantomjs installed.\n\n#### watch - `make watch`\nThis is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. Requires the Watchr gem.\n\nShould you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running the makefile commands, be sure to first uninstall any previous versions (global and local) you may have installed, and then rerun `npm install`.\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease submit all pull requests against *-wip branches. If your pull request contains JavaScript patches or features, you must include relevant unit tests. All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](http://github.com/mdo/code-guide), maintained by [Mark Otto](http://github.com/mdo).\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n## Authors\n\n**Mark Otto**\n\n+ [http://twitter.com/mdo](http://twitter.com/mdo)\n+ [http://github.com/mdo](http://github.com/mdo)\n\n**Jacob Thornton**\n\n+ [http://twitter.com/fat](http://twitter.com/fat)\n+ [http://github.com/fat](http://github.com/fat)\n\n\n\n## SASS: Conversion less to Sass\n\nThe Twitter Bootstrap was lovingly converted to Sass by:\n\n**John W. Long**\n\n+ http://twitter.com/johnwlong\n+ http://github.com/jlong\n\n**Jeremy Hinegardner**\n\n+ http://twitter.com/copiousfreetime\n+ http://github.com/copiousfreetime\n\n**m5o**\n\n+ http://twitter.com/m5o\n+ http://github.com/m5o\n\n**smt**\n\n+ http://twitter.com/tudorstudio\n+ http://github.com/smt\n\nAnd [others](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap/contributors)\n\n\n\n## SASS: Conversion Quick Tips\n\n* replace @ with $\n* replace . with @include for mixins\n* replace `spin` with `adjust-hue`\n* add !default to variable definitions\n* replace #gradient > .vertical with @include gradient-vertical\n* replace #grid > .style with @include grid-style\n* use grid-core and grid-fluid mixins instead of #grid > .core and #grid > .fluid\n* use font-shorthand instead of #font > .shorthand\n* replace fadein with fade-in\n* move @import for reset below mixins, because it uses tab-focus mixin in bootstrap.scss\n* explicitly provide .clearfix, .hide-text and .input-block-level for compatibility with LESS output\n* pass grid-* mixin arguments to generators, because otherwise the generator mixins will use the default variables pull transition definition into variable\n\n\n\n## SASS: Installation via Composer\n\nIf you already use Composer, the php dependency manager, installing\nsass-twitter-bootstrap is as simple as typing :\n```shell\ncomposer.phar require jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap:x.y.z\n```\nThis will install version x.y.z from packagist.org\n\nYou'll probably want to make sure you get minor updates, like this:\n```shell\ncomposer.phar require jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap:~x.y.z\n```\nor like this:\n```shell\ncomposer.phar require jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap:x.y.*\n```\n\n\n\n## Copyright and license\n\nCopyright 2012 Twitter, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this work except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License in the LICENSE file, or at:\n\n  [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
