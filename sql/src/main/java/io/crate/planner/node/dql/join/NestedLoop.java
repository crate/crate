/**
 * Plan that will be executed with the awesome nested loop algorithm
 * performing CROSS JOINs
 * <p>
 * This Plan makes a lot of assumptions:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> limit and offset are already pushed down to left and right plan nodes
 * <li> where clause is already splitted to left and right plan nodes
 * <li> order by symbols are already splitted, too
 * <li> if the first order by symbol in the whole statement is from the left node,
 * set <code>leftOuterLoop</code> to true, otherwise to false
 * <p>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Properties:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> the resulting outputs from the join operations are the same, no matter if
 * <code>leftOuterLoop</code> is true or not - so the projections added,
 * can assume the same order of symbols, first symbols from left, then from right.
 * If sth. else is selected a projection has to reorder those.
