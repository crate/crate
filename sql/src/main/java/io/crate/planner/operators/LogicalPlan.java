/**
 * LogicalPlan is a tree of "Operators"
 * This is a representation of the logical order of operators that need to be executed to produce a correct result.
 *
 * {@link #build(PlannerContext, ProjectionBuilder, int, int, OrderBy, Integer, Row, Map)}  is used to create the
 * actual "physical" execution plan.
 *
 * A Operator is something like Limit, OrderBy, HashAggregate, Join, Union, Collect
 * <pre>
 *     select x, y, z from t1 where x = 10 order by x limit 10:
 *
 *     Limit 10
 *        |
 *     Order By x
 *         |
 *     Collect [x, y, z]
 * </pre>
 *
 * {@link #build(PlannerContext, ProjectionBuilder, int, int, OrderBy, Integer, Row, Map)}  is called
 * on the "root" and flows down.
 * Each time each operator may provide "hints" to the children so that they can decide to eagerly apply parts of the
 * operations
 *
 * This allows us to create execution plans as follows::
 *
 * <pre>
 *     select x, y, z from t1 where order by x limit 10;
 *
 *
 *          Merge
 *         /  limit10
 *       /         \
 *     Collect     Collect
 *     limit 10    limit 10
 *
 * </pre>
