/**
 * BatchIterator implementation that can transform rows using {@link Input}s and {@link CollectExpression}s.
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *     BatchIterator source data:
 *      [ 1, 2, 3 ]
 *
 *     Input: add(inputColumn(0), 2)
 *     expressions: InputColumnExpression
 *
 *     output:
 *      [ 3, 4, 5 ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is similar to the `map` function (from the stream API), except that the transformation happens using a
 * shared object via stateful inputs/expressions.
