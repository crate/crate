/**
 * This scalar function removes the 3-valued logic from the tree of operators below it.
 * If used as a normal scalar (eg. SELECT ignore3vl(<some_boolean_expression)) it just
 * evaluates NULL to false.
 *
 * Its main usage though is in the WHERE clause because it acts as a marker
 * that {@link io.crate.lucene.LuceneQueryBuilder} can use in order to skip the 3-valued logic
 * filtering on queries which results in a better performance. The 3-valued logic filtering is
 * applied with a generic function filtering which is slow, so if this logic is not needed and
 * the null can be translated to false, the generic function is completely removed.
