/**
 * In ElasticSearch a routing value of '' is treated as if there is no routing
 * (see https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/1450). This behaviour leads to
 * inconsistent routings, since in the case of a missing routing the _id is used as fallback. This would break
 * the contract of having the same value of the routing field on only one shard. So in Crate the behaviour is
 * different and is asserted via tests in this class.
