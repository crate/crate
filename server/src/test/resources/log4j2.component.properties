# RandomizedRunner renames threads and we'd like to look at accurate thread
# names. Also, this is the default in log4j2's master branch for versions of
# Java after 1.8_102 which most of the versions we use are anyway. After that
# version of Java calling `Thread.getName()` doesn't allocate so UNCACHED
# ought to be faster than CACHED because it doesn't have to deal with
# ThreadLocals.
# While we don't use AsyncLogger, we do end up with mutable log events and
# those use this key for configuration.
AsyncLogger.ThreadNameStrategy = UNCACHED
