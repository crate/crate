/**
 * Represents a connection to a single remote cluster. In contrast to a local cluster a remote cluster is not joined such that the
 * current node is part of the cluster and it won't receive cluster state updates from the remote cluster. Remote clusters are also not
 * fully connected with the current node. From a connection perspective a local cluster forms a bi-directional star network while in the
 * remote case we only connect to a subset of the nodes in the cluster in an uni-directional fashion.
 * <p>
 * This class also handles the discovery of nodes from the remote cluster. The initial list of seed nodes is only used to discover all nodes
 * in the remote cluster and connects to all eligible nodes.
 * <p>
 * In the case of a disconnection, this class will issue a re-connect task to establish at most
 * {@link SniffConnectionStrategy#REMOTE_NODE_CONNECTIONS} until either all eligible nodes are exhausted or the maximum number of
 * connections per cluster has been reached.
