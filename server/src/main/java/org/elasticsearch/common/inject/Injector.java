/**
 * Builds the graphs of objects that make up your application. The injector tracks the dependencies
 * for each type and uses bindings to inject them. This is the core of Guice, although you rarely
 * interact with it directly. This "behind-the-scenes" operation is what distinguishes dependency
 * injection from its cousin, the service locator pattern.
 * <p>
 * Contains several default bindings:
 * <ul>
 * <li>This {@link Injector} instance itself
 * <li>A {@code Provider<T>} for each binding of type {@code T}
 * <li>The {@link java.util.logging.Logger} for the class being injected
 * <li>The {@link Stage} in which the Injector was created
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Injectors are created using the facade class {@link Guice}.
 * <p>
 * An injector can also {@link #injectMembers(Object) inject the dependencies} of
 * already-constructed instances. This can be used to interoperate with objects created by other
 * frameworks or services.
