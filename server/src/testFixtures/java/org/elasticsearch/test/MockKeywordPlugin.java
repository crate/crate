 * Some tests rely on the keyword tokenizer, but this tokenizer isn't part of lucene-core and therefor not available
 * in some modules. What this test plugin does, is use the mock tokenizer and advertise that as the keyword tokenizer.
 *
 * Most tests that need this test plugin use normalizers. When normalizers are constructed they try to resolve the
 * keyword tokenizer, but if the keyword tokenizer isn't available then constructing normalizers will fail.
