Crate provides pre-built releases for convenience, also known as convenience

third-party dependencies.  Hence, convenience releases will contain a mix of
CrateDB source code and third-party build-time dependencies not listed in the

However, for the time being, if you make use of convenience releases, it is
your responsibility to check the licensing status of the bundled third-party
build-time dependencies.
