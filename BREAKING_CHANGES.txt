Temporary file for breaking changes. The entries should latter be integrated
into CHANGES.txt


## Breaking Changes 

 - It is no longer possible to specify the location of the config file with the
   `CONF_FILE` environment variable, or the `-Des.config`, `-Des.default.config`,
   or `-Delasticsearch.config` parameters.

   The config file must now be named `crate.yml` and must be located in the
   default `config/` directory, in the directory specified in the `CONF_DIR`
   environmental variable, or the one specified in the `-Des.path.home`
   parameter.

 - The `gateway.local.sync` setting has been renamed to `translog.sync_interval`


## Other changes


 - Removed internal migration code that ensured schema backward compatibility
   to Crate versions <= 0.45.
   This means a direct upgrade from a version that is lower than 0.45 is no
   longer possible. Only upgrades from a version > 0.46 and <= 0.54 are
   possible.
