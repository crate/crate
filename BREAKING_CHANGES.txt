## Breaking Changes 

 - It is no longer possible to specify the location of the config file with the
   `CONF_FILE` environment variable, or the `-Des.config`, `-Des.default.config`,
   or `-Delasticsearch.config` parameters.

   The config file must now be named `crate.yml` and must be located in the
   default `config/` directory, in the directory specified in the `CONF_DIR`
   environmental variable, or the one specified in the `-Des.path.home`
   parameter.

 - The `gateway.local.sync` setting has been renamed to `translog.sync_interval`
