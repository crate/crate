Unreleased Changes
==================

This file collects *unreleased* changes only.

For release notes, see:

  https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/release_notes/index.html

For developers: changes should be recorded here (using RST syntax) as you are
developing CrateDB. When a new release is being cut, changes will be moved to
the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

 - Parsing support of time values has been changed:

   - The unit ``w`` representing weeks is no longer supported.

   - Fractional time values (e.g. ``0.5s``) are no longer
     supported. For example, this means when setting timeouts,
     ``0.5s`` will be rejected and should instead be input as ``500ms``.

 - The already unused ``path.work`` node setting has been removed.

 - The node setting ``bootstrap.mlockall`` has been renamed to
   ``bootstrap.memory_lock``.

 - The ``keyword_repeat`` and ``type_as_payload`` built-in token
   filter have been removed.

 - The ``classic`` built-in analyzer has been removed.

 - The shard balance related cluster settings
   ``cluster.routing.allocation.balance.primary`` and
   ``cluster.routing.allocation.balance.replica`` have been removed.

 - Some ``recovery`` related cluster settings have been removed or replaced:

   - The ``indices.recovery.concurrent_streams`` cluster setting is
     now superseded by
     ``cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries``.

   - The ``indices.recovery.activity_timeout`` cluster setting have
     beend renamed to ``indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout``.

   - Following ``recovery`` cluster settings are removed:

     - ``indices.recovery.file_chunk_size``

     - ``indices.recovery.translog_ops``

     - ``indices.recovery.translog_size``

     - ``indices.recovery.compress``

 - Logging is now configured by ``log4j2.properties`` instead of ``logging.yml``.

 - The Plugin interface has changed, injecting classes on ``shard`` or
   ``index`` levels is no longer supported.

 - It's no longer possible to run crate as the unix ``root`` user.

 - Some ``translog`` related table settings have been removed or replaced:

   - The ``index.translog.interval``, ``translog.disable_flush`` and
     ``translog.flush_threshold_period`` table settings have been removed.

   - The ``index.translog.sync_interval`` table setting doesnâ€™t accept a
     value less than 100ms which prevents fsyncing too often if async
     durability is enabled. The special value ``0`` is no longer supported.

   - The ``index.translog.flush_threshold_ops`` table setting is not
     supported anymore. In order to control flushes based on the
     transaction log growth use
     ``index.translog.flush_threshold_size`` instead.

 - The ``COPY FROM`` statement now requires column names to be quoted in
   the JSON file being imported.

 - Queries on columns with ``INDEX OFF`` will now fail instead of
   always resulting in an empty result.

 - Configuration support using system properties has been dropped.

 - It's no longer possible to use ``Hadoop 1.x`` as a ``repository``
   for snapshots.

 - Changed default bind and publish address from ``0.0.0.0`` to the system
   ``loopback`` addresses.

Changes
=======

 - Added built-in ``fingerprint``, ``keep_types``, ``min_hash`` and
   ``serbian_normalization`` token filter.

 - Added a ``fingerprint`` built-in analyzer.

 - Upgraded to Elasticsearch 5.0.2

 - Improved performance of blob stats computation by calculating them in an 
   incremental manner.

 - Optimized performance of negation queries on ``NOT NULL`` columns.
   e.g.::

     select * from t where not_null_col != 10

 - Updated documentation to indicate that it's not possible to use
    ``object``, ``geo_point``, ``geo_shape`` or ``array`` in the
    ``ORDER BY`` clause.
