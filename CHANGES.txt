Unreleased Changes
==================

This file collects *unreleased* changes only.

For release notes, see:

  https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/release_notes/index.html

For developers: changes should be recorded here (using RST syntax) as you are
developing CrateDB. When a new release is being cut, changes will be moved to
the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Enabled ``mapping.total_fields.limit`` setting for tables in order to be
   able to increase maximum number of columns higher than the default of
   ``1000``.

 - Table functions now support value expressions as arguments.

Fixes
=====

 - Updated Crash to ``0.21.4`` which fixes an issue with ``\verbose`` command
   not working correctly when ``Crash`` is started without ``--verbose``.

 - Implemented flexible return type of sum-function depending on the input
   types, which was previously only double.

 - Fixed a regression causing incorrect results for queries with ``DISTINCT``
   on scalar functions. E.g.::

     SELECT DISTINCT upper(name) FROM t

 - Fixed a race condition which made it possible to create new columns in a
   partition of a partitioned table that didn't match the type of the same
   column of sibling partitions.

 - Fixed a NPE when running ``select port from sys.nodes`` and
   ``psql.enabled: false`` was set

 - Fixed an issue where the user that gets provided by the client on connect is
   not always used as current user if host based authentication is disabled.

 - Corrected the documentation of the ``version`` column of the ``sys.snapshots``
   table. It was described as the CrateDB version wereas it's an internal
   version instead.

 - Dropping an empty partitioned table did not drop related table privileges.

 - Implemented ``NOT NULL`` constraint validation for nested object columns,
   which was previously ignored. E.g.::

     CREATE TABLE test (
       stuff object(dynamic) AS (
         level1 object(dynamic) AS (
           level2 string not null
         ) NOT NULL
       ) NOT NULL
     )

 - Internal system queries are now executed under the "crate" superuser if user
   management is enabled.

 - ``!= ANY()`` could not operate on arrays with more than 1024 elements. This
   limit has been increased by default to 8192. A new node setting:
   ``indices.query.bool.max_clause_count`` has been exposed to allow to
   configure this limit.

 - Fixed an issue which caused unrelated table privileges to be lost after a
   table was renamed.

 - Fixed an issue that prevents CrateDB from bootstrap on Windows hosts.
