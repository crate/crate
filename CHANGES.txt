Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Expose fields for ``information_schema.columns`` and
   ``information_schema.tables`` so that it conforms to SQL-99 standard.

 - Improved the resiliency of the retrieval of large results via HTTP. Queries
   are now aborted and result in an error if they consume too much memory.

 - Changed the ``QueryStats`` JMX MBean to deliver node-based values instead of
   cluster-based values.
   This makes it possible to spot performance discrepancies between nodes more
   easily.

 - Added support for joins on virtual tables.

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed a ``COPY FROM`` issue that caused imports into tables with certain
   combinations of PARTITIONED BY, PRIMARY KEY and GENERATED COLUMNS to fail.

 - Fixed an issue with algorithm that tries to reorder the joined tables using
   the optimum ordering. The issue caused an exception to be thrown when join
   conditions contain table(s) which are not part of the adjacent joined tables.
   E.g.::

    SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 JOIN t3 JOIN t4 ON t4.id = t2.id

 - Fixed an issue that could cause ``sys.operations`` entries to remain even
   after the operation has finished.

 - Fixed a NPE when querying ``sys.shards`` table

 - Optimized the JMX ``QueryStats`` MBean to prevent it from putting too much
   load on the cluster.

 - Fixed the calculation of the ``OverallQueryAverageDuration`` ``QueryStats``
   MBean.

 - The internal ``fetchSize`` is now dynamic based on configured heap and has
   an upper bound to prevent ``OutOfMemory`` errors if a postgres client
   retrieves a large result set without setting a ``fetchSize``, or setting a
   ``fetchSize`` which is too large.

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause ``KILL (ALL)`` to terminate a node
   instead of interrupting a query.

 - Log failed authentication attempts at log level ``WARN``

 - Fix NPE when ordering by system columns
