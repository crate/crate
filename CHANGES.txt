Breaking Changes

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

 - Allow ``DISTINCT`` to operate on literals. E.g.::

     SELECT DISTINCT ['val1', 'val2'], col1, col2, ... FROM t

 - Allow ``GROUP BY`` on any literal. E.g.::

      SELECT {a=1, b=2}, COUNT(*) FROM t GROUP BY 1

 - Fixed an issue that prevents CrateDB from bootstrap on Windows hosts.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause the ``_score >= <minScore>`` filter to not
   work correctly if used in a query with an ``ORDER BY`` clause.
