Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Expose fields for ``information_schema.columns`` and
   ``information_schema.tables`` so that it conforms to SQL-99 standard.

 - Improved the resiliency of the retrieval of large results via HTTP. Queries
   are now aborted and result in an error if they consume too much memory.

 - Extended the output of the  ``EXPLAIN`` statement.

 - Added support for joins on virtual tables.

 - Changed the ``QueryStats`` JMX MBean to deliver node-based values instead of
   cluster-based values.
   This makes it possible to spot performance discrepancies between nodes more
   easily.

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed an issue that could cause ``sys.operations`` entries to remain even
   after the operation has finished.

 - Fixed a NPE when querying ``sys.shards`` table

 - Optimized the JMX ``QueryStats`` MBean to prevent it from putting too much
   load on the cluster.

 - Fixed the calculation of the ``OverallQueryAverageDuration`` ``QueryStats``
   MBean.

 - The internal ``fetchSize`` is now dynamic based on configured heap and has
   an upper bound to prevent ``OutOfMemory`` errors if a postgres client
   retrieves a large result set without setting a ``fetchSize``, or setting a
   ``fetchSize`` which is too large.

 - Log failed authentication attempts at log level ``WARN``

 - Fix NPE when ordering by system columns
