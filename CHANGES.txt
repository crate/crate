Breaking Changes
================

 - Changed default bind and publish address from ``0.0.0.0`` to the system
   ``loopback`` addresses.

Changes
=======

 - Updated documentation to indicate that it's not possible to use
    ``object``, ``geo_point``, ``geo_shape`` or ``array`` in the
    ``ORDER BY`` clause.

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause a memory leak.

 - Fixed cluster check, which warns about tables that need upgrade for
   future compatibility, to include only tables that differ from
   current storage engine major version number.

 - Fixed a bug which caused non-grouping aggregations on a join with explicit
   ``CROSS JOIN`` syntax to fail.

 - Correctly expose ``stats.service.interval`` in the ``sys.cluster``
   table.
