Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Added support for ``COPY FROM ... RETURN SUMMARY`` which will return a result
  set with detailed error reporting of imported rows.

- Added a ``sys.jobs_metrics`` table which contains query latency information.

- The setting ``es.api.enabled`` has been marked as deprecated and will be
  removed in a future version. Once removed it will no longer be possible to
  use the ES API.
  Please create feature requests if you're using the ES API and cannot use the
  SQL interface as substitute.

- Introduced the ``EXPLAIN ANALYZE`` statement for query profiling.

- Added `typbasetype` column to the `pg_catalog.pg_type` table.

- Added support for `SHOW TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` statement.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could cause a cluster check warning, telling the user to
  upgrade tables which do not require upgrades.

- Fixed an issue that could cause ``HTTP`` requests using empty ``bulk_args``
  to fail.

- Fixed NullPointerException which could be thrown when deleting a table and
  querying `size` from the `sys.shards` table.
