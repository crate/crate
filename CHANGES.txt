Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Enabled ``mapping.total_fields.limit`` setting for tables in order to be
   able to increase maximum number of columns higher than the default
   of ``1000``.

Fixes
=====

 - Optimized the algorithm that determines the best ordering of the tables in
   a ``JOIN``.

 - Fixed a regression causing incorrect results for queries with ``DISTINCT``
   on scalar functions. E.g.::

     SELECT DISTINCT upper(name) FROM t

 - Fixed a NPE when running ``select port from sys.nodes`` and
   ``psql.enabled: false`` was set

 - Implemented ``NOT NULL`` constraint validation for nested object columns,
   which was previously ignored. E.g.::

     CREATE TABLE test (
       stuff object(dynamic) AS (
         level1 object(dynamic) AS (
           level2 string not null
         ) NOT NULL
       ) NOT NULL
     )
