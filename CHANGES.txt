Changelog
=========

 - Fixed cluster check, which warns about tables that need upgrade for
   future compatibility, to include only tables that differ from
   current storage engine major version number.

 - Fixed issue which prevents blob directories from being removed after a
   ``drop blob table`` command when a custom blob location is configured.
