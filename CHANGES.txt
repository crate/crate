Unreleased Changes
==================

This file collects *unreleased* changes only.

For release notes, see:

  https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/release_notes/index.html

For developers: changes should be recorded here (using RST syntax) as you are
developing CrateDB. When a new release is being cut, changes will be moved to
the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

 - ``CURRENT_USER``, ``USER`` and ``SESSION_USER`` are now reserved words as we 
   introduced them as system functions. These terms will not be available to 
   be used as table, and column names and for already existing entities they 
   will have to be quoted when referenced (otherwise the terms will be treated 
   as function calls).

 - ``SELECT`` statements without any ``FROM`` items are no longer executed
   against the ``sys.cluster`` table, but against a virtual table with no
   columns. Queries including ``sys.cluster`` columns but no explicit ``FROM``
   item will now result in a ``ColumnUnknownException``.

 - onModule() method had been removed from io.crate.Plugin interface,
   so createGuiceModules() must be used instead.

 - ``srv`` and ``azure`` are no longer valid configuration options for ``discovery.type``.
   Instead there is a new ``discovery.zen.hosts_provider`` settings which can
   be set to either ``srv`` or ``azure``.

Breaking Changes (Packaging only)
=================================

 - The sigar jar and object files have been moved from ``plugins/sigar`` to
   ``lib/sigar``.

Changes
=======

 - Fixed an issue that caused an exception to be thrown when using
   ``COUNT(*)`` with subselects that return one row. E.g.::

     SELECT count(*) FROM t1 WHERE id > (select max(col1) from t2)

 - Updated Elasticsearch to 5.2.2

 - Upgraded Crash to 0.21.0.

 - Added support for ``GRANT`` and ``REVOKE`` privileges for accessing the
   cluster. Currently supported privilege types: ``DQL``, ``DML`` and ``DDL``.

 - Added support for client certificate authentication via HBA.

 - Added SSL/TLS support for HTTP endpoints.

 - Added new HBA setting ``ssl`` which allows to control whether
   users have to connect with ssl enabled or disabled.

 - Added SSL/TLS support for PostgreSQL Wire Protocol.

 - Extended the output of the  ``EXPLAIN`` statement.

 - Added support for joins on virtual tables.

Fixes
=====

 - Fix thread-safety issue for scalar functions ``md5`` and ``sha1``

 - ``information.schema.tables`` now returns the default routing hash function
   if none is present in the table metadata.
   (Issue: https://github.com/crate/crate/issues/5857)

 - Throw proper exception when using the ``_raw`` column inside the where clause
   instead of silently ignoring it.
