Unreleased Changes
==================

This file collects *unreleased* changes only.

For release notes, see:

  https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/release_notes/index.html

For developers: changes should be recorded here (using RST syntax) as you are
developing CrateDB. When a new release is being cut, changes will be moved to
the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

 - ``SELECT`` statements without any ``FROM`` items are no longer executed
   against the ``sys.cluster`` table, but against a virtual table with no
   columns. Queries including ``sys.cluster`` columns but no explicit ``FROM``
   item will now result in a ``ColumnUnknownException``.

 - onModule() method had been removed from io.crate.Plugin interface,
   so createGuiceModules() must be used instead.

 - ``srv`` and ``azure`` are no longer valid configuration options for ``discovery.type``.
   Instead there is a new ``discovery.zen.hosts_provider`` settings which can
   be set to either ``srv`` or ``azure``.

Breaking Changes (Packaging only)
=================================

 - The sigar jar and object files have been moved from ``plugins/sigar`` to
   ``lib/sigar``.

Changes
=======

 - Added support for client certificate authentication via HBA.

 - Added SSL/TLS support for HTTP endpoints.

 - Added new HBA setting ``ssl`` which allows to control whether
   users have to connect with ssl enabled or disabled.

 - Added SSL/TLS support for PostgreSQL Wire Protocol.

 - Updated Elasticsearch to 5.1.2
 - Extended the output of the  ``EXPLAIN`` statement.

 - Added support for joins on virtual tables.

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed an issue that could cause ``DELETE`` by query  and ``UPDATE``
   statements to fail on datasets larger than 10_000 rows.

 - Fixed issue where bulk operations like ``insert from dynamic queries`` and
   ``COPY FROM`` did not stop after being killed.

 - ``CREATE USER`` and ``DROP USER`` statements will now only respond after all
   nodes in the cluster processed the change.
