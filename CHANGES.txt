Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Expose statement classification in ``sys.jobs_log`` table.

- Added a ``sys.jobs_metrics`` table which contains query latency information.

- The setting ``es.api.enabled`` has been marked as deprecated and will be
  removed in a future version. Once removed it will no longer be possible to
  use the ES API.
  Please create feature requests if you're using the ES API and cannot use the
  SQL interface as substitute.

- Introduced the ``EXPLAIN ANALYZE`` statement for query profiling.

- Added ``typbasetype`` column to the ``pg_catalog.pg_type`` table.

- Added support for the ``SHOW TRANSACTION_ISOLATION`` statement.

Fixes
=====

- Handle ``STRING_ARRAY`` as argument type for user-defined functions correctly
  to prevent an ``ArrayStoreException``.

- Fixed an issue that could cause a cluster check warning, telling the user to
  upgrade tables which do not require upgrades.

- Fixed an issue that could cause ``HTTP`` requests using empty ``bulk_args``
  to fail.

- Fixed ``NullPointerException`` which could be thrown when deleting a table
  and querying the ``size`` column from the ``sys.shards`` table.
