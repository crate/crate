Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed an issue which resulted in an exception when using the same global
   aggregation symbol twice as a select item on a join query.

 - Provide comprehensive error message when using  ``NULL`` literal in
    ``GROUP BY``.

 - Allow ``DISTINCT`` to operate on literals. E.g.::

     SELECT DISTINCT ['val1', 'val2'], col1, col2, ... FROM t

 - Allow ``GROUP BY`` on any literal. E.g.::

     SELECT {a=1, b=2}, COUNT(*) FROM t GROUP BY 1

 - Fixed an issue that can hang the nodes when running an insert from query
   statement for a large dataset when the target table is an empty
   partitioned table.

 - Fixed an issue that prevents CrateDB from bootstrap on Windows hosts.

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause ``UPDATE`` or ``DELETE`` statements
   to get stuck.

 - Fixed a ClassCastException that could occur on certain queries if connected
   via the postgres protocol.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause the ``_score >= <minScore>`` filter to not
   work correctly if used in a query with an ``ORDER BY`` clause.
