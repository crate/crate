Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Added support for joins on virtual tables.

 - Changed the ``QueryStats`` JMX MBean to deliver node-based values instead of
   cluster-based values.
   This makes it possible to spot performance discrepancies between nodes more
   easily.

Fixes
=====

 - Optimized the JMX ``QueryStats`` MBean to prevent it from putting too much
   load on the cluster.

 - Fixed the calculation of the ``OverallQueryAverageDuration`` ``QueryStats``
   MBean.

 - The internal ``fetchSize`` now has an upper bound to prevent ``OutOfMemory``
   errors if a postgres client retrieves a large result set without setting a
   ``fetchSize``, or setting a ``fetchSize`` which is too large.

 - Log failed authentication attempts at log level ``WARN``
