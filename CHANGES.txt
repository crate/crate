Changelog
=========

 - Fixed an issued that caused conditions like ``not x = any( )`` to not 
   find empty lists when used in WHERE clauses.

 - Improved error handling when using LIMIT/OFFSET that exceed Integer range

 - Fixed a regression introduced in 1.1.0 that caused statements like ``COPY t
   TO '/invalid/directory/'`` to get stuck instead of resulting in an error.
