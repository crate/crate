Changes

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause ``UPDATE`` or ``DELETE`` statements
   to get stuck.

 - Fixed a ClassCastException that could occur on certain queries if connected
   via the postgres protocol.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause the ``_score >= <minScore>`` filter to not
   work correctly if used in a query with an ``ORDER BY`` clause.
