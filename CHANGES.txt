Unreleased Changes
==================

This file collects *unreleased* changes only.

For release notes, see:

  https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/release_notes/index.html

For developers: changes should be recorded here (using RST syntax) as you are
developing CrateDB. When a new release is being cut, changes will be moved to
the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

 - Columns aren't implicitly cast to a type anymore. Whenever columns are
   compared to Literals (e.g. 'string', 1, 1.2), these literals will be
   converted to the column type but not vice-versa. The column can still be
   manually cast to a type by using a cast function.

Changes
=======

- Added new system table ``sys.allocations`` which lists shards and their
  allocation state including the reasoning why they are in a certain state.

- Upgraded Elasticsearch to v5.6.3

- Added new table setting ``allocation.max_retries`` that defines the number of
  attempts to allocate a shard before giving up and leaving it unallocated.

- Function arguments are now linked to each other, where possible. This enables
  type inference between arguments such that arguments can be converted to match
  a function's signature. For example, ``coalesce(integer, long)`` would have
  resulted in an "unknown function" message. We now convert this call into
  ``coalesce(long, long)``. The conversion is possible through a type precedence
  list and convertibility checks on the data types.

- Functions which accept regular expression flags now throw an error when
  invalid flags are provided.

- Added the ``pg_backend_pid()`` function for enhanced PostgreSQL compatibility.
