Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====
 
 - Internal system queries are now executed under the "crate" superuser if
   user management is enabled.

 - ``!= ANY()`` could not operate on arrays with more than 1024 elements. This
   limit has been increased by default to 8192. A new node setting:
   ``indices.query.bool.max_clause_count`` has been exposed to allow to
    configure this limit.

 - Added support for conditionals with ``NULL`` arguments.

 - Fixed an issue that caused wrong results to be returned for global
   aggregation on ``JOINS`` when literal expression in ``WHERE`` clause is
   evaluated to false. E.g.::

     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1, t2 WHERE 1=2

 - Provide comprehensive error message when using  ``NULL`` literal in
    ``GROUP BY``.

 - Allow ``DISTINCT`` to operate on literals. E.g.::

     SELECT DISTINCT ['val1', 'val2'], col1, col2, ... FROM t

 - Allow ``GROUP BY`` on any literal. E.g.::

      SELECT {a=1, b=2}, COUNT(*) FROM t GROUP BY 1

 - Fixed an issue that prevents CrateDB from bootstrap on Windows hosts.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause the ``_score >= <minScore>`` filter to not
   work correctly if used in a query with an ``ORDER BY`` clause.
