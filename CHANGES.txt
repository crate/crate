Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed an issue that caused a table that is not part of the "doc" schema to be
   unavailable/hidden if it gets closed using ``ALTER TABLE``.

 - Fixed an issue where the query circuit breaker would be tripped after 
   running several queries due to incorrect memory tracking. Subsequent 
   operations would've failed due to the lack of circuit breaker cleanup.

 - Improve shards view performance in the Admin UI

 - Remove horizontal scroll from the console editor in the Admin UI.
