==================
Unreleased Changes
==================

This file collects *unreleased* changes only.

For release notes, see:

  https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/release_notes/index.html

For developers: changes should be recorded here (using RST syntax) as you are
developing CrateDB. When a new release is being cut, changes will be moved to
the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

 - ``CURRENT_USER``, ``USER`` and ``SESSION_USER`` are now reserved words as we
   introduced them as system functions. These terms will not be available to
   be used as table, and column names and for already existing entities they
   will have to be quoted when referenced (otherwise the terms will be treated
   as function calls).

 - ``SELECT`` statements without any ``FROM`` items are no longer executed
   against the ``sys.cluster`` table, but against a virtual table with no
   columns. Queries including ``sys.cluster`` columns but no explicit ``FROM``
   item will now result in a ``ColumnUnknownException``.

 - onModule() method had been removed from io.crate.Plugin interface,
   so createGuiceModules() must be used instead.

 - ``srv`` and ``azure`` are no longer valid configuration options for ``discovery.type``.
   Instead there is a new ``discovery.zen.hosts_provider`` settings which can
   be set to either ``srv`` or ``azure``.

Breaking Changes (Packaging only)
=================================

 - The sigar jar and object files have been moved from ``plugins/sigar`` to
   ``lib/sigar``.

Changes
=======

 - Queries which contain a correlated subquery will now result in an error
   stating that correlated subqueries are not supported, instead of a more
   confusing error indicating that a relation is unknown.

 - Added column ``username`` to ``sys.jobs`` and ``sys.jobs_log`` that contains
   the username under which the job was invoked.

 - Upgraded the Admin UI to 1.4.0

 - Upgraded Crash to 0.21.2

 - The table setting ``recovery.initial_shards`` has been deprecated. You may
   set ``gateway.local.initial_shards`` per node instead. Crate will continue to
   read the old setting but applications should be migrated to the new setting.

 - Updated Elasticsearch to 5.2.2

 - Added support for ``GRANT`` and ``REVOKE`` privileges for accessing the
   cluster. Currently supported privilege types: ``DQL``, ``DML`` and ``DDL``.

 - Added support for client certificate authentication via HBA.

 - Added SSL/TLS support for HTTP endpoints.

 - Added new HBA setting ``ssl`` which allows to control whether
   users have to connect with ssl enabled or disabled.

 - Added SSL/TLS support for PostgreSQL Wire Protocol.

 - Extended the output of the  ``EXPLAIN`` statement.

 - Added support for joins on virtual tables.

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed an issue that caused an exception if a column gets added to a table
   that has been created with CrateDB version <= 1.1.

 - Fixed a regression that caused queries with a ``GROUP BY`` on array-columns,
   which are wrapped in a scalar function, to fail.

 - Corrected wrong enterprise configuration example in ``crate.yml`` from
   ``auth.host_based.http_default_user`` to ``auth.trust.http_default_user``
