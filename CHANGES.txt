Unreleased Changes
==================

This file collects *unreleased* changes only.

For release notes, see:

  https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/release_notes/index.html

For developers: changes should be recorded here (using RST syntax) as you are
developing CrateDB. When a new release is being cut, changes will be moved to
the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

 - Due to the support of user defined functions there are new reserved keywords
   in the Crate SQL dialect: ``RETURNS``, ``CALLED`, ``REPLACE``, ``FUNCTION``,
   ``LANGUAGE``, ``INPUT``

 - The ``enterprise.license`` setting is set to ``true`` by default.
   If you start crate enterprise without a valid enterprise license,
   you are entering the unlicensed mode.

 - The default value of the ``node.max_local_storage_nodes`` node setting has
   been changed to ``1`` to prevent running multiple nodes on the same data path
   by default. Previous versions of CrateDB defaulted to allowing up to ``50``
   nodes running on the same data path. This was confusing where users
   accidentally started multiple nodes and ended up thinking they have lost data
   because the 2nd node will start with an empty directory. Running multiple
   nodes on the same data path tends to be an exception, so defaulting towards
   safer out-of-the-box settings is reasonable.

 - Parsing support of time values has been changed:

   - The unit ``w`` representing weeks is no longer supported.

   - Fractional time values (e.g. ``0.5s``) are no longer
     supported. For example, this means when setting timeouts,
     ``0.5s`` will be rejected and should instead be input as ``500ms``.

 - The already unused ``path.work`` node setting has been removed.

 - The node setting ``bootstrap.mlockall`` has been renamed to
   ``bootstrap.memory_lock``.

 - The ``keyword_repeat`` and ``type_as_payload`` built-in token
   filter have been removed.

 - The ``classic`` built-in analyzer has been removed.

 - The shard balance related cluster settings
   ``cluster.routing.allocation.balance.primary`` and
   ``cluster.routing.allocation.balance.replica`` have been removed.

 - Some ``recovery`` related cluster settings have been removed or replaced:

   - The ``indices.recovery.concurrent_streams`` cluster setting is
     now superseded by
     ``cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries``.

   - The ``indices.recovery.activity_timeout`` cluster setting have
     beend renamed to ``indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout``.

   - Following ``recovery`` cluster settings are removed:

     - ``indices.recovery.file_chunk_size``

     - ``indices.recovery.translog_ops``

     - ``indices.recovery.translog_size``

     - ``indices.recovery.compress``

 - Logging is now configured by ``log4j2.properties`` instead of ``logging.yml``.

 - The Plugin interface has changed, injecting classes on ``shard`` or
   ``index`` levels is no longer supported.

 - It's no longer possible to run crate as the unix ``root`` user.

 - Some ``translog`` related table settings have been removed or replaced:

   - The ``index.translog.interval``, ``translog.disable_flush`` and
     ``translog.flush_threshold_period`` table settings have been removed.

   - The ``index.translog.sync_interval`` table setting doesn’t accept a
     value less than 100ms which prevents fsyncing too often if async
     durability is enabled. The special value ``0`` is no longer supported.

   - The ``index.translog.flush_threshold_ops`` table setting is not
     supported anymore. In order to control flushes based on the
     transaction log growth use
     ``index.translog.flush_threshold_size`` instead.

 - The ``COPY FROM`` statement now requires column names to be quoted in
   the JSON file being imported.

 - Queries on columns with ``INDEX OFF`` will now fail instead of
   always resulting in an empty result.

 - Configuration support using system properties has been dropped.

 - It's no longer possible to use ``Hadoop 1.x`` as a ``repository``
   for snapshots.

 - Changed default bind and publish address from ``0.0.0.0`` to the system
   ``loopback`` addresses.

Changes
=======

 - Added JavaScript language for functions

 - Added support for user defined functions.

 - Added cluster check and warning for unlicensed usage of CrateDB Enterprise.

 - Added a ``fingerprint`` built-in analyzer.

 - Upgraded to Elasticsearch 5.0.2

 - Improved performance of blob stats computation by calculating them in an 
   incremental manner.

 - Optimized performance of negation queries on ``NOT NULL`` columns.
   e.g.::

     select * from t where not_null_col != 10

 - Updated documentation to indicate that it's not possible to use
    ``object``, ``geo_point``, ``geo_shape`` or ``array`` in the
    ``ORDER BY`` clause.
