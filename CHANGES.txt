Breaking Changes

Changes
=======

- Added a ``sys.jobs_metrics`` table which contains query latency information.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused the CrateDB process CPU calculation in the
  Admin-UI to be false.

- Fixed the default log file name to ``crate.log`` if no cluster name was
  explicitly specified in the settings.

- Fixed an issue that caused a ``ClassCastException`` to be thrown when querying
  the ``sys.health`` table on a cluster that has ``blob`` tables.

- Fixed support for views with aliased literals in select list / groupBy /
  orderBy.

- Fixed a bug affecting the Postgres Wire Protocol's Simple Query mode and
  queries which contained strings with escaped single quotes and semicolons,
  e.g. `'Hello ''Joe'';'`.

- Fixed an issue in the Postgres Wire Protocol's Simple Query mode which would
  send an empty statement if the query string contained trailing whitespace.
