Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Expose fields for ``information_schema.columns`` and
   ``information_schema.tables`` so that it conforms to SQL-99 standard.

 - Extended the output of the  ``EXPLAIN`` statement.

 - Added support for joins on virtual tables.

Fixes
=====

 - Reflect internally used default size for ``translog.flush_threshold_size``
   also in documentation and expose the correct default value in table
   settings.

 - Added missing table setting ``translog.durability`` which is required and
   and must be set accordingly so that ``translog.sync_interval`` takes effect.

 - Fixed a NPE when querying ``sys.shards`` table

 - Log failed authentication attempts at log level ``WARN``
