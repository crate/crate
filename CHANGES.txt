Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======
 
 - Added table function ``generate_series`` that generates a series of numbers
   from ``start`` to ``end`` by ``step`.`

 - Table functions now support value expressions as arguments.

Fixes
=====

 - Added support for conditionals with ``NULL`` arguments.
 
 - Do not include Lucene indices (metadata) of ``BLOB`` tables in snapshot
   when using ``CREATE SNAPSHOT`` with ``ALL``, because the actual binary
   files of ``BLOB`` tables cannot be backed up using ``SNAPSHOT/RESTORE``
   functionality.

 - Fixed rename table operation for empty partitioned tables.

 - Fixed an issue which caused unrelated table privileges to be lost after a
   table was renamed.

 - Fixed an issue that caused wrong results to be returned for global
    aggregation on ``JOINS`` when literal expression in ``WHERE`` clause is
    evaluated to false. E.g.::

      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1, t2 WHERE 1=2

 - Fixed an issue which resulted in an exception when using the same global
   aggregation symbol twice as a select item on a join query.

 - Provide comprehensive error message when using  ``NULL`` literal in
    ``GROUP BY``.

 - Allow ``DISTINCT`` to operate on literals. E.g.::

     SELECT DISTINCT ['val1', 'val2'], col1, col2, ... FROM t

 - Allow ``GROUP BY`` on any literal. E.g.::

     SELECT {a=1, b=2}, COUNT(*) FROM t GROUP BY 1

 - Fixed an issue that can hang the nodes when running an insert from query
   statement for a large dataset when the target table is an empty
   partitioned table.

 - Fixed an issue that prevents CrateDB from bootstrap on Windows hosts.

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause ``UPDATE`` or ``DELETE`` statements
   to get stuck.

 - Fixed a ClassCastException that could occur on certain queries if connected
   via the postgres protocol.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause the ``_score >= <minScore>`` filter to not
   work correctly if used in a query with an ``ORDER BY`` clause.
