Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Greatly improved performance of queries that uses scalar functions inside the
  ``WHERE`` clause.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an Admin UI issue that caused the ``Cluster`` tab to not be loaded
  correctly.

- Map the Tab key to insert spaces instead of a tab character in the query
  console of the Admin UI.

- Fixed an issue that caused the user name to not be displayed in the Admin UI.

- Fixed a race condition that caused DELETE or UPDATE statements to result in an
  error if a shard was being relocated or in a RECOVERY state.

- Improved error message when using the `DISTINCT` clause on unsupported data
  types. Also improved documentation to note the data type restriction.

- Fix log verbosity by only logging the HTTP SSL enabled/disabled message once
  at startup.

- Fixed an issue that could cause ``INSERT INTO`` statements into partitioned
  tables to not work correctly. This only occurred if a ``query`` instead of
  the ``VALUES`` clause was used.

- Fixed the evaluation of JavaScript user defined functions that caused CrateDB
  to crash because of an unhandled assertion when providing the UDF with
  EcmaScript 6 arrow function syntax (``var f = (x) => x;``).

- Fixed an issue where batch operations executed using the postgres protocol 
  could've returned 0 as row count, even though the actual row count was 
  different.

- Fixed a bug which could cause job entries in `sys.jobs` not being removed
  when a connection error occurred while transferring the results of the job
  execution.

- Fixed an issue that could cause a ``ALTER TABLE`` statement to fail with an
  exception on partitioned tables created with CrateDB < 1.2.

- Enforce validation of column constraints for ``INSERT`` statements with a
  subquery as source and in combination with ``ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE``.

- Fixed an issue that caused an error to be thrown when using ``GROUP BY`` or
  ``DISTINCT`` on a column of type ``IP`` in case there are rows with null
  value for that column.
