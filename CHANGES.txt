Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

- Fix a NPE exception which could occur when joining four tables with a join
  condition which referred to fields from the leftmost relation.

- Fix a problem that caused ``WITHIN`` queries to return no or incorrect
  results.

- Fixed an issue where internal cluster state updates could reset the active
  ingestion rules, causing all ingest operations to stop.

- Fix the problem that ``stats.breaker.*`` settings were not applied to the
  correct circuit breaker.

- Fixed an issue that caused an error ``Primary key value must not be NULL``
  to be thrown when trying to insert rows in a table that has a generated
  column which is used both in ``PARTITION_BY`` and ``PRIMARY KEY``.

- The postgres wire protocol service can now be bound to IPv6 addresses as
  documented.
