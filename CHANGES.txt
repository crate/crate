Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

- Fix a NPE exception which could occur when joining four tables with a join
  condition which referred to fields from the leftmost relation.

- Fix a problem that caused ``WITHIN`` queries to return no or incorrect
  results.

- Fix the problem that ``stats.breaker.*`` settings were not applied to the
  correct circuit breaker.

- Fixed an issue that caused an error ``Primary key value must not be NULL``
  to be thrown when trying to insert rows in a table that has a generated
  column which is used both in ``PARTITION_BY`` and ``PRIMARY KEY``.

- The postgres wire protocol service can now be bound to IPv6 addresses as
  documented.

- Fixed issue that caused ``NULL`` values to be displayed as
  empty objects in the console view of the Admin UI.

- Fixed an issue that resulted in aliases overriding column names when a
  subselect is used and a column appears in the outer SELECT multiple times,
  without an alias and with alias or with multiple aliases. E.g.::

    SELECT a, a AS newcol FROM (SELECT a FROM t WHERE a > 1)
    SELECT a AS newcol1, a AS newcol2 FROM (SELECT a FROM t WHERE a > 1)
