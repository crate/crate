Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Added a new ``stats.jobs_log_filter`` setting which can be used to control
  what kind of entries are recorded into the ``sys.jobs_log`` table.

- Expose statement classification in ``sys.jobs_log`` table.

- Added a ``sys.jobs_metrics`` table which contains query latency information.

- The setting ``es.api.enabled`` has been marked as deprecated and will be
  removed in a future version. Once removed it will no longer be possible to
  use the ES API.
  Please create feature requests if you're using the ES API and cannot use the
  SQL interface as substitute.

- Introduced the ``EXPLAIN ANALYZE`` statement for query profiling.

- Added ``typbasetype`` column to the ``pg_catalog.pg_type`` table.

- Added support for the ``SHOW TRANSACTION_ISOLATION`` statement.

Fixes
=====

- Handle ``STRING_ARRAY`` as argument type for user-defined functions correctly
  to prevent an ``ArrayStoreException``.
