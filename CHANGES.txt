Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a performance regression resulting in a table scan instead of a NO-MATCH
  if a sub-query used inside a ``WHERE`` clause returns no result.

- Fixed an issue which resulted in an exception when a routing column was
  compared against a sub-query inside a ``WHERE`` clause.
