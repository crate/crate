**Problem description**:

<!-- 
Please don't write "doesn't work". Instead, try to write a detailed description
of the behavior you observe and explain what behavior you'd expect.

If a query returns an error message, please include the error message and a
stacktrace of the error.  To get the stack trace either run the query in crash
with \verbose on, or run it in the AdminUI Console with `[x] Show error trace`
set.

If a query behaves in an unexpected way but doesn't return an error, please
include the server logs.

If you are experiencing performance issues, please provide the garbage
collection logs.

**Steps to reproduce**:

<!-- Please include table schema and some sample records and the statements
that lead to the problem. -->
