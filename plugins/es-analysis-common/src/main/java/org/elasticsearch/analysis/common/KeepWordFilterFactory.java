 * Configuration options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@value #KEEP_WORDS_KEY} the array of words / tokens to keep.</li>
 * <li>{@value #KEEP_WORDS_PATH_KEY} an reference to a file containing the words
 * / tokens to keep. Note: this is an alternative to {@value #KEEP_WORDS_KEY} if
 * both are set an exception will be thrown.</li>
 * <li>{@value #KEEP_WORDS_CASE_KEY} to use case sensitive keep words. The
 * default is <code>false</code> which corresponds to case-sensitive.</li>
