DEVELOPMENT
===========

Prerequisites
=============

Crate Data is developed in Java_ 7, so a working Java 7 virtual machine
installation is required. We recommend using `Oracle's Java`_ on OSX
and OpenJDK_ on Linux Systems.


Submodules
==========

Init/Update
-----------

In order to build the project the first time it is necessary to
initialize and update all submodules. Which is done via the
following command from within the crate repository::

 $ git submodule update --init

Build
=====

This project uses Gradle_ as build tool. It can be invoked by
executing ``./gradlew``. The first time this command is executed it is
bootstrapped automatically, therefore there is no need to install
gradle on the system.

In order to build the documentation and run integration tests a Python_
executable called `python2.7` needs to be in the $PATH. The documentation is
generated by Sphinx_.

Before creating a new distribution, a new version and tag should be created:

 - Add a new version to the ``io.crate.Version`` class.

 - Point the CURRENT version in that class to the newly added version.

 - Add a note for the new version at the ``CHANGES.txt`` file.

 - Commit e.g. using message 'prepare release x.x.x'.

 - Push to origin

 - Create a tag using the ``create_tag.sh`` script
   (run ``./devtools/create_tag.sh``).

Now everything is ready for building a new distribution, either
manually or let jenkins do the job as usual :-)

Building a tarball and a zip is done by gradle with the command::

 $ ./gradlew dist

Building a release tarball is done via the ``release`` task. This task
actually only runs the ``distTar`` task but additionally checks that
the output of ``git describe --tag`` matches the current version of
Crate::

 $ ./gradlew release

The resulting tarball and zip will reside in the folder
``./app/build/distributions``.

It is also possible to install the distribution locally by running::

 $ ./gradlew installDist

The root of the installation can then be found under
``./app/build/install/crate``. Start the server with::

 $ ./app/build/install/crate/bin/crate

IntelliJ
========

To use this project in intellij do not use the built-in JetGradle
Plugin. Instead use gradle directly by running::

 ./gradlew idea

This will create the project files.

Run/Debug Configurations
------------------------

It is also possible to run Crate Data nodes directly from within IntelliJ. But
before that can be done a bit of preparation is necessary.

First create the folders for the configuration and data::

    for i in {1..2}; do mkdir -p sandbox/crate_$i/{config,data,plugins}; done

In order for the admin interface to work an additional folder and symbolic
links are necessary::

    for i in {1..2}; do mkdir -p sandbox/crate_$i/plugins/crate-admin/; done

    ln -s $PWD/admin-ui/crate-admin/dist/ sandbox/crate_1/plugins/crate-admin/_site
    ln -s $PWD/admin-ui/crate-admin/dist/ sandbox/crate_2/plugins/crate-admin/_site


Then create the configuration files for both nodes::

    touch sandbox/crate_1/config/crate.yml
    touch sandbox/crate_2/config/crate.yml

And add the following settings::

    node.name: local1

    http.port: 19201
    transport.tcp.port: 19301
    network.host: localhost

    multicast.enabled: false
    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts:
      - 127.0.0.1:19301
      - 127.0.0.1:19302

.. note::

    In the second files the port number and node name has to be changed.
    19201 to 19202 and 19301 to 19302.

In addition to the `crate.yml` file it is also recommended to create a logging
configuration file for both nodes. To do so create the files
`sandbox/crate_1/config/logging.yml` and `sandbox/crate_2/config/logging.yml`.

A minimal example for the logging configuration looks like this::

    rootLogger: INFO, console
    logger:
      # log action execution errors for easier debugging
      action: DEBUG
      crate.elasticsearch.blob: TRACE

    appender:
      console:
        type: console
        layout:
          type: consolePattern
          conversionPattern: "[%d{ISO8601}][%-5p][%-25c] %m%n"

After that the Run/Debug Configurations can be added within IntelliJ. Go to the
`Run/Debug Configurations` window and add a new `Application` configuration
(one for each node) with the following settings:

+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Main class               | io.crate.bootstrap.CrateF                     |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| VM Options               | -Des.path.home=/full/path/to/sandbox/crate_1/ |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Use classpath of module: | app                                           |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

Debugging
=========

To run the app locally for debugging use::

 ./gradlew runDebug

It will then listen for a remote debugger on port 5005.

Testing
=======

Unit tests can be run like this::

  $ ./gradlew test

It is also possible to run tests in parallel in order to speed up
execution time by setting the project property ``testForks`` like
this::

  $ ./gradlew test -PtestForks=5

To run a single test pass the test.single argument::

  $ ./gradlew test -Dtest.single='YourTestClass'

Test Coverage
--------------

Create test coverage reports with `jacoco`_ in every module's ``build/reports/jacoco`` directory::

  $ ./gradlew jacocoTestReport

Findbugs
--------

Running `FindBugs`_ against our code base::

  $ ./gradlew findBugsMain

the findbugs check will also be executed when running::

  $ ./gradlew check

Benchmark
=========

A Benchmark for our SQL Interface can be run by calling::

  $ ./gradlew bench

It will output some results to stdout (read between the lines) and finally you will
receive information where more detailed benchmark-results got stored.

Writing Documentation
=====================

The documentation is maintained under the ``docs`` directory and
written in ReStructuredText_ and processed with Sphinx_.

Note that the documentation is no longer distributed with this project.

Normally the documentation is built by `Read the Docs`_.
However if you work on the documentation you can run sphinx
directly, which can be done by just running ``bin/sphinx`` in the ``docs``
directory. The output can then be found in the ``out/html`` and
``out/text`` directories.

Before you can run ``bin/sphinx`` you need to setup a development environment
by running `bootstrap.py` inside the ``docs`` directory::

    python bootstrap.py

And afterwards run buildout::

    ./bin/buildout -N

The documentation is tested when running the ``itest`` task.
Also the ``itest`` task is run as a dependency of the ``dist`` task.
