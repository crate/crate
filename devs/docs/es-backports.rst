======================================
Backporting changes from Elasticsearch
======================================

With CrateDB 4.0.0, we integrated the Elasticsearch code and then pruned out
everything we don't use.

With CrateDB 4.2.0, we changed the module structure so that Elasticsearch and
CrateDB code is no longer split, but mixed within the same modules. The
majority is in the ``server`` component.

We still want to keep many of the components up-to-date, while other
components will converge more and more over time.

The areas where we want to stay close to upstream Elasticsearch are mostly:

- Engine
- Snapshotting
- Recovery
- Discovery and master election


Applied changesets
==================

Patches should be applied in order. A backport commit message should be
prefixed with ``bp:``. This allows us to verify later on whether a patch was
applied using something like this::

    sh$ git log --oneline --grep 'bp:'


If a patch is skipped, use the ``sp:`` prefix instead.

To see if there are new changes, you can use ``git log`` in the Elasticsearch
repository. For example::

    git log --oneline 48d31194c25.. -- \
      server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/{engine,snapshots,store,translog,shard,seqno,mapper,codec}/ \
      server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/indices/recovery/ \
      server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/transport

Here ``48d31194c25`` is the starting point, it shows any changes since then
thatvaffected files in the given folder.

(Note that there may be changes before ``48d31194c25`` that are missing.)

We should eventually bump the reference point once all patches have been
applied to a certain point.

Below lists the changesets that we applied. This should be updated whenever a
backport is made. If a patch is skipped because it is not applicable, it
should be crossed out as well.

- ``x`` to mark applied patches
- ``s`` for skipped patches if they are not applicable (for example, if the
  functionality is not present in CrateDB)
- ``d`` marks a delayed patch - a non-trivial change we should apply that
  does not affect too any components, so delaying it doesn't make applying
  other patches more difficult
