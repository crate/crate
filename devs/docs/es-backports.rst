Backporting changes from Elasticsearch
======================================

With CrateDB 4.0.0 we integrated the Elasticsearch code and then pruned out
everything we don't use.

With CrateDB 4.2.0 we changed the module structure, so that Elasticsearch and
CrateDB code is no longer split, but mixed within the same modules. The
majority is in ``server``.


We still want to keep many of the components up-to-date, while other components
will converge more and more over time.

Areas were we want to stay close to Elasticsearch upstream are mostly:

- Engine
- Snapshotting
- Recovery
- Discovery and master election


Applied change sets
===================

Patches should be applied in order. A backport commit message should be
prefixed with ``bp:``, this allows us to verify if a patch was applied later on
using something like this::

    sh$ git log --oneline --grep 'bp:'


If a patch is skipped, use the ``sp:`` prefix instead.

To see if there are new changes you can use
``git log`` in the Elasticsearch repository, like so::

    sh$ git log --oneline ca5771c1f4a.. -- server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/{engine,snapshots,store,translog,shard,seqno,mapper,codec}/

Here ``ca5771c1f4a`` is the starting point, it shows any changes since then that
affected files in the given folder.

(Note that there may be changes before ``ca5771c1f4a`` that are missing)

We should eventually bump the reference point, once all patches have been
applied to a certain point.

Below lists the change sets we applied. This should be updated whenever a
backport is made. If a patch is skipped because it is not applicable, it should
be crossed out as well. ``x`` is used to mark applied patches, ``s`` for
skipped patches if they're no applicable - for example if the functionality is
not present in CrateDB. ``d`` marks a delayed patch - a change we should apply,
but which is non-trivial to apply and at the same time doesn't affect too any
components, so delaying it doesn't make applying other patches more difficult.
