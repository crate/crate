 * This base class provides a testCluster that will keep its state across all test methods and will
 * only reset itself {@link #afterClass()}
 *
 * This will be a lot faster then having to wipe the state after each test method.
 * The downside is that the tests aren't as isolated and if data is created it might affect other tests.
 *
 * For all other Integration test purposes use {@link io.crate.test.integration.CrateIntegrationTest}
