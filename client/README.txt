======================
Crate Data Java Client
======================

.. highlight:: java

The client module exposes a very simple interface to query Crate using
SQL.

Installation
============

Maven
-----

The easiest way to use the crate client is to include it as a dependency using
maven::

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.crate<groupId>
        <artifactId>crate-client</artifactId>
        <version>0.38.0</version>
    </dependency>

From source
-----------

See :ref:`Development <client_develop>` for further details.

Usage
=====

A minimal example is just a few lines of code::

    import io.crate.client.CrateClient;

    CrateClient client = new CrateClient("server1.crate.org:4300", "server2.crate.org:4300");
    SQLResponse r = client.sql("select firstName, lastName from users").actionGet();

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(r.cols()));
    // outputs ["firstName", "lastName"]

    for (Object[] row: r.rows()){
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(row));
    }
    // outputs the users. For example:
    // ["Arthur", "Dent"]
    // ["Ford", "Perfect"]

The `CrateClient` takes multiple servers as arguments. They are used in a
round-robin fashion to distribute the load. In case a server is unavailable it
will be skipped.

By default, the column data types are not serialized. In order to get
these, one must defined it at the `SQLRequest` object::

    import io.crate.client.CrateClient;

    CrateClient client = new CrateClient("server1.crate.org:4300", "server2.crate.org:4300");

    SQLRequest request = new SQLRequest("select firstName, lastName from users");
    request.includeTypesOnResponse(true);

    SQLResponse r = client.sql().actionGet();

    // Get the data type of the first column
    DataType dataType = r.columnTypes()[0]
    System.out.print(dataType.getName())
    // outputs: "string"

.. note::

   Queries are executed asynchronous. `client.sql("")` will return a
   `Future<SQLResponse>` and code execution is only blocked if
   `.actionGet()` is called on it.
