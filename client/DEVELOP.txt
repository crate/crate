Development
===========

Prerequisites
=============

The Crate Java client requires a working `Java 8`_ virtual machine.
We recommend using `Oracle's Java`_ on OSX and OpenJDK_ on Linux Systems.

We recommend installing `Java 8`_ update 20 or later.

Get the Source
==============

Right now the client is part of the main distribution. So you need to clone
the `crate` repository.

Cloning the source code installs a copy of the repository on your computer.
You must have git installed to do this::

  git clone git@github.com:crate/crate.git


Build
=====

This project uses Gradle_ as build tool. It can be invoked by
executing ``./gradlew``. The first time this command is executed it is
bootstrapped automatically, therefore there is no need to install
gradle on the system.

A JAR package can be built by::

  ./gradlew :client:clean :client:install

The built JAR package will be written to ``<PROJECT_HOME>/client/build/libs/``.
Just add this path to your CLASSPATH in order to work with this JAR.


Testing
=======

Tests can be run like this::

  $ ./gradlew :client:test

It is also possible to run tests in parallel in order to speed up
execution time by setting the project property ``testForks`` like
this::

  $ ./gradlew :client:test -PtestForks=5
