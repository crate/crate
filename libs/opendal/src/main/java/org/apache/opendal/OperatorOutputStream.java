/* TEMPORARY MONKEYPATCH
 *
 * Patched copy of the class shipped in opendal-0.48.2.jar. It shadows the
 * original via classpath order (crate-libs-opendal precedes the opendal jar
 * both in the {@code lib/*.jar} glob used by bin/crate and on Maven test
 * classpaths).
 *
 * <p>The original declares {@code native byte[] writeBytes(...)} while the
 * Rust JNI implementation returns void. The JVM then interprets the garbage
 * return register as a JNI object handle, which on aarch64 Linux surfaces as
 * a bare NullPointerException on every write, breaking S3/Azure/GCS/file
 * snapshot repositories and {@code COPY TO}. This copy corrects the native
 * method declarations to match the Rust implementation. See
 * https://github.com/crate/crate/issues/19723 and
 * https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/7906
 * 
 * <p>Remove this class (and its exemption in JarHell#checkClass) once OpenDAL
 * releases version 0.58.1 whose Java binding declares these natives
 * as void.
