     * mode and fall back to the legacy duplicate checks, we still need to keep the custom duplicate checks around and we also need to keep
     * the tests around.
     *
     * If this fallback via system property is removed one day in the future you can remove all tests that call this method and also remove
     * the corresponding custom duplicate check code.
