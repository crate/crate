Configuration
=============

Since Crate has sensible defaults, there is no configuration needed at
all for basic operation.

Crate is mainly configured via a configuration file, which is located
at ``config/crate.yml``. The vanilla configuration file distributed
with the package has all available settings as comments in it along
with the according default value.

The location of the config file can be specified upon startup like
this::

  sh$ ./bin/crate -Des.config=/path/to/config.yml

Any option can be configured either by the config file or as system
property. If using system properties the required prefix 'es.' will be
ignored.

For example, configuring the cluster name by using system properties
will work this way::

 sh$ ./bin/crate -Des.cluster.name=cluster

This is exactly the same as setting the cluster name in the config
file::

 cluster.name = cluster

Settings will get applied in the following order where the latter one
will overwrite the prior one:

 1. internal defaults
 2. system properties
 3. options from config file


Logging
-------

Crate uses the internal logging abstraction of Elasticsearch_ and
comes, out of the box, with Log4j_. It tries to simplify log4j
configuration by using YAML to configure it. The logging configuration
file is at ``config/logging.yml``

.. _YAML: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML

.. _Elasticsearch: http://www.elasticsearch.org
