Setup
=====

The ``crate-client`` jar files are hosted on `Bintray`_ and available via
`JCenter`_.

If you want to use ``crate-client`` with your Maven project you need to
add the Bintray repository to your ``pom.xml``::

    ...
    <repositories>
        ...
        <repository>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </snapshots>
            <id>central</id>
            <name>bintray</name>
            <url>http://dl.bintray.com/crate/crate</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    ...
    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.crate</groupId>
            <artifactId>crate-client</artifactId>
            <version>...</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ...

.. highlight:: groovy

Using Gradle::

    repositories {
        ...
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile 'io.crate:crate-client:...'
        ...
    }


Alternatively you can follow the instructions on the Bintray repository overview
page
by clicking the "Set me up!" button.


Dependencies
============

The ``crate-client`` includes all its dependencies bundled under the
``io.crate.shade``
namespace in order to avoid conflicts with other jars included in your
application.

.. note::

    It is not supported to load the client jar and the crate server jars in one
    application, as this will result in conflicts.
