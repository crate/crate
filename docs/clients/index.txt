Getting the Source Code from Github
-----------------------------------

Right now the client is part of the main distribution. So you need to clone
the `crate` repository.

Cloning the source code installs a copy of the repository on your computer.
You must have git installed to do this::

    git clone git@github.com:crate/crate.git
