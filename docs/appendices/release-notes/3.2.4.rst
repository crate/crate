.. _version_3.2.4:

=============
Version 3.2.4
=============

Released on 2019/02/25.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.2.4.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.1 release before moving to
    3.2.4.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_3.2.0`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

    Please consult the :ref:`version_3.0.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.2 and must be recreated before moving to 3.2.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog

Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue that would cause the results of a nested loop join statement
  ordered by fields from a single relation, in the form of ``SELECT t1.x, t2.x
  FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t1.x = t2.x ORDER BY t2.y``, to be out of order.

- Fixed an issue that caused the Admin UI monitoring graphs to be cut off.

- Fixed an issue that caused a ``stream has already been operated upon or
  closed`` exception to be thrown when joining on a right :ref:`subquery
  <gloss-subquery>` that contained a ``GROUP BY`` clause on one number column.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``INSERT INTO`` with a subquery to not insert into
  partitioned tables where the :ref:`partition columns
  <gloss-partition-column>` had a ``NOT NULL`` constraint.

- Fixed a regression that caused inserts which create new dynamic columns to
  fail if the table was created in an earlier version of CrateDB.

- Fixed an issue that caused inserts into partitioned tables where the
  :ref:`partition column <gloss-partitioned-column>` is generated and based on
  the child of an object to fail.

- Fixed an issue that caused the Basic Authentication prompt to fail in Safari.
