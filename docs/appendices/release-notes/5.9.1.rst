.. NOTE::
    In development. 5.9.1 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.9.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.8 release before moving to
    5.9.1.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.8.x to 5.9.1 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.9 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that would cause users and roles to loose irrelevant
  privileges, like: ``Administration Language (AL)``, when a table or a view
  is dropped.

- Improved the memory accounting for values of type ``geo_shape`` to avoid
  running into out of memory errors or higher than expected GC load when running
  queries like ``INSERT INTO ... (query)``.

- Fixed a regression introduced in 5.8.4 leading to a rejection of writes into
  a column of the ``OBJECT(IGNORED)`` type if it had an array sub-column with
  mixed types.

- Fixed an issue resulting in different (and partly wrong)
  ``sys.allocations.decisions`` results when querying the table on different
  nodes.
