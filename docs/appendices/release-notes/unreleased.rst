    These changes have not yet been released.

    If you are viewing this document on the Crate.io website, these changes
    reflect what exists on `the master branch`_ in Git. This is where we
    collect changes before they are ready for release.

.. WARNING::

    Unreleased changes may not be ready for general use and could lead to data
    corruption or data loss. You should `back up your data`_ before
    experimenting with unreleased changes.

.. ================

.. Changes should be recorded here as you are developing CrateDB. When a new
.. release is being cut, changes will be moved to the appropriate release notes
.. file.

.. When resetting this file during a release, leave the headers in place, but
.. add a single paragraph to each section with the word "None".

.. Always cluster items into bigger topics. Link to the documentation whenever feasible.
.. Remember to give the right level of information: Users should understand

Changes
=======

- Changed the behavior of ``SHOW search_path`` to omit the implicit
  ``pg_catalog`` schema, unless the user set it explicitly. This matches the
  PostgreSQL behavior.

- Optimized the evaluation of ``CASE`` expressions to prevent stack overflows
  for very large expressions.

- Allowed schema and table names to contain upper case letters. This can be
  achieved by quoting the names. Unquoted names with upper case letters are
  converted to lower cases which has been the existing behaviour.

- Allowed schema and table names to start with ``_``.

Fixes
=====

.. If you add an entry here, the fix needs to be backported to the latest
.. stable branch. You can add a version label (`v/X.Y`) to the pull request for
.. an automated mergify backport.

- Fixed an issue that caused correlated sub-queries to fail with an
  ``IllegalStateException`` when the outer query contained multiple joins.
  An example ::

    CREATE TABLE a (x INT, y INT, z INT); // tables b, c, d created as a
    SELECT
      (SELECT 1 WHERE a.x=1 AND b.y=1 AND c.z=1)
    FROM a, b, c, d;
    IllegalStateException[OuterColumn `y` must appear in input of
    CorrelatedJoin]

- Fixed an issue that caused ``DROP FUNCTION`` to throw a
  ``ColumnUnknownException`` instead of an ``IllegalArgumentException``
  justifying why a function cannot be dropped.

- Updated to Admin UI 1.24.3, which fixed a compatibility issue where graphs
  have not been working on the "Overview" page with CrateDB 5.2, and added
  syntax highlighting for functions added in CrateDB 5.2: ``MIN_BY``,
  ``MAX_BY``, ``HAS_DATABASE_PRIVILEGE``, ``PARSE_URI``, and ``PARSE_URL``.
