Changes
=======

- Added a :ref:`btrim <scalar-btrim>` scalar function.

- Added support for underscores in numeric literals. Example::

    SELECT 1_000_000;

- Added a :ref:`statement_timeout <conf-session-statement-timeout>` session
  setting that allows to set a timeout for queries.

- Added ``any_value`` as an alias to the ``arbitrary`` aggregation function, for
  compliance with the SQL2023 standard. Extended the aggregations to support any
  type.

- Added support for ``ORDER BY``, ``MAX``, ``MIN`` and comparison operators on
  expressions of type ``INTERVAL``.

- Bumped the version of PostgreSQL wire protocol to ``14`` since ``10`` has been
  deprecated.

- Allow casts in both forms: ``CAST(<literal or parameter> AS <datatype>)`` and
  ``<literal or parameter>::<datatype>`` for ``LIMIT`` and ``OFFSET`` clauses,

  e.g.::

    SELECT * FROM test OFFSET CAST(? AS long) LIMIT '20'::int

- Added the ``pg_catalog.pg_cursors`` table to expose open cursors.

- Added the
  :ref:`standard_conforming_strings <conf-session-standard_conforming_strings>`
  read-only session setting for improved compatibility with PostgreSQL clients.

Fixes
=====

.. If you add an entry here, the fix needs to be backported to the latest
.. stable branch. You can add a version label (`v/X.Y`) to the pull request for
.. an automated mergify backport.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``geo_shape_array IS NULL`` expressions to fail
  with an ``IllegalStateException``.

- Fixed an issue that caused the actual cast/type conversion error to be hidden
  when it failed for a sub-column of an object column, when using a client
  statement with parameters i.e (python).::

    CREATE TABLE a (b OBJECT(DYNAMIC) AS (c REAL));
    # create a connection and a cursor and then:
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO a VALUES (?)", [({"c": True},)])

- Fixed a regression that caused the ``-h`` option in ``bin/crate`` to fail with
  an ``Error parsing arguments!`` error.

- Added a :ref:`null_or_empty <scalar-null-or-empty>` scalar function that can
  be used as a faster alternative to `IS NULL` if it's acceptable to match on
  empty objects. This makes it possible to mitigate a performance regression
  introduced in 5.0.3 and 5.1.1

- Fixed an issue that led to ``NullPointerException`` when trying to query an
  ``OBJECT`` field with no values, using the ``NOT`` operator, e.g.::

     CREATE TABLE test (obj OBJECT(DYNAMIC)); -- no data
     SELECT myobj FROM test WHERE (obj::TEXT) NOT LIKE '%value%';

- Fixed an issue in the PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation that could
  lead to ``ClientInterrupted`` errors with some clients. An
  example client is `pg-cursor <https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-cursor>`_.

- Fixed an issue that allowed creating columns with names conflicting with
  subscript pattern, such as ``"a[1]"``, a subscript expression enclosed in
  double quotes.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``SQLParseException`` when quoted subscript
  expressions contained quotes. An example would be querying an array with the
  name containing quotes like ``SELECT "arr""[1]";``.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`` statement to assign
  ``PRIMARY KEY`` to wrong columns, when adding multiple primary key columns,
  having none-primary columns in-between.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`` statement to assign a
  wrong type to ``ARRAY(TEXT)`` column and create a ``TEXT`` column instead if
  column has a ``FULLTEXT`` index.
