Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused ``UNION ALL`` statements to succeed or throw
  unexpected exceptions when the ``SELECT`` results for ``UNION ALL`` included
  object types with identically named but differently typed sub-columns.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``date_format()`` to return wrong values when used
  with the ``%D`` specifier (day of month as ordinal number) for 11th, 12th and
  13th.
