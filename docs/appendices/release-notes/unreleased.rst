Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a ``stream has already been operated upon
  or closed`` error when using primary key lookup operations as part of a query
  with several JOIN clauses.

- Fixed a regression that caused queries which used a parameter placeholder in
  a join condition to fail with an ``The assembled list of ParameterSymbols is
  invalid. Missing parameters`` error.
