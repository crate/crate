Breaking Changes
================

- Removed support for HDFS snapshot repositories. We suspect nobody uses it
  anymore. If you require HDFS support please reach out to us, if there is
  enough interest we may be able to provide a plugin with the functionality.


Deprecations
============

None


Changes
=======

- Implemented cancelling requests section of PostgreSQL wire protocol.

- Added the :ref:`Logical Replication <administration-logical-replication>`
  feature allowing to replicate data across multiple clusters.

- Added the :ref:`array_position <scalar-array_position>` function which 
  returns the position of the first occurrence of the provided value in an 
  array. A starting position can be optionally provided.

- Optimized the casting from string to arrays by avoiding an unnecessary string
  to byte conversion.

- Fixed an issue with the handling of intervals in generated columns. The table
  creation failed when an interval is included in a function call as part of a
  generated column.

- Write blocks added due to low disk space are now automatically removed if a
  node again drops below the high watermark.

- Added a ``WITH`` clause parameter, ``validation`` to ``COPY FROM`` which
  can enable or disable the newly added type validation feature. Please see
  :ref:`validation <sql-copy-from-validation>` for more details.

- Added type validation logic to ``COPY FROM``. Now raw data will be parsed and
  validated against the target table schema and casted if possible utilizing
  :ref:`type casting <data-types-casting>`.

- Improved the evaluation performance of implicit casts by utilize the compile
  step of the function to determine the return type.

- Fixed an issue with the handling of quoted identifiers in column names where
  certain characters break the processing. This makes sure any special characters
  can be used as column name.

- Added a ``flush_stats`` column to the :ref:`sys.shards <sys-shards>` table.

- Allowed users to be able to specify different S3 compatible storage endpoints
  to ``COPY FROM/TO`` statements by embedding the host and port to the ``URI``
  parameter and also a ``WITH`` clause parameter ``protocol`` to choose between
  ``HTTP`` or ``HTTPS``.

- Added the option to import CSV files without field headers using the ``COPY
  FROM`` statement.

- Added the option to import only a subset of columns using ``COPY FROM`` when
  import CSV files with headers.

- Added the option to run ``COPY FROM`` and ``COPY TO`` operations in the
  background without waiting for them to complete.

Fixes
=====

.. If you add an entry here, the fix needs to be backported to the latest
.. stable branch. You can add a version label (`v/X.Y`) to the pull request for
.. an automated mergify backport.

- Fixed a race condition that could cause a ``blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/4/Table or
  partition preparing to close`` error when inserting into a partitioned table
  where a single partition got closed.

- Fixed an issue that caused an ``Relation unknown`` error while trying to
  close an empty partitioned table using ``ALTER TABLE ... CLOSE``.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``COPY FROM RETURN SUMMARY`` fail non-gracefully
  in case of import from CSV containing invalid line(s).

- Bumped JNA library to version 5.10.0. This will make CrateDB start without
  JNA library warnings on M1 chip based MacOS systems.

- Updated to Admin UI 1.20.2, which fixes duplicate entries in query history.
