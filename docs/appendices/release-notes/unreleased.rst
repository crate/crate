Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused ``ALTER TABLE <tbl> ADD COLUMN <columName> INDEX
  USING FULLTEXT`` statements to ignore the ``INDEX USING FULLTEXT`` part.

- Fixed a performance regression introduced in 4.2 which could cause queries
  including joins, virtual tables and ``LIMIT`` operators to run slower than
  before.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``INSERT INTO`` statements to fail on partitioned
  tables where the partitioned column is generated and the column and value are
  provided in the statement.
