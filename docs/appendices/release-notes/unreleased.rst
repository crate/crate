Breaking Changes
================

- Changed arithmetic operations ``*``, ``+`` and ``-`` of types ``integer``
  and ``bigint`` to throw an exception instead of rolling over from positive
  to negative or the other way around.

- Changed how columns of type :ref:`geo_point_data_type` are being communicated
  to PostgreSQL clients: Before clients were told that those columns are double
  arrays, now they're correctly mapped to the PostgreSQL ``point`` type. This
  means that applications using clients like ``JDBC`` will have to be adapted
  to use ``PgPoint``. (See `Geometric DataTypes in JDBC
  <https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/geometric.html>`_)

Deprecations
============

- Deprecated the `node.store.allow_mmapfs` setting in favour of
  :ref:`node.store.allow_mmap <node.store_allow_mmap>`.

Changes
=======

- Added support for CIDR notation comparisons through special purpose
  operator ``<<`` associated with type ip.
  Statements like ``192.168.0.0 << 192.168.0.1/24`` are true,
  ``select ip from ips_table where ip << 192.168.0.1/24`` returns
  matching :ref:`ip <ip-type>` addresses.

- Added the ``ltrim`` and ``rtrim`` scalar functions.

- Improved the error messages that were returned if a relation or schema is not
  found. They now may include suggestions for similarly named tables. This
  should make typos more apparent and can help users figure out that they were
  missing double quotes in case the table names contain upper case letters.

- Added a ``seq_no_stats`` and a ``translog_stats`` column to the
  :ref:`sys.shards <sys-shards>` table.

- Added new system table :ref:`sys.segments <sys-segments>` which contains
  information about the Lucene segments of a shard.

- Added a ``node`` column to :ref:`sys.jobs_log <sys-logs>`.

- Added support for the operator :ref:`ILIKE <sql_dql_like>`, the case
  insensitive complement to ``LIKE``.

- Reduced recovery time by sending file-chunks concurrently. It applies
  only for when transport communication is secured or compressed. The number of
  chunks is controlled by the :ref:`indices.recovery.max_concurrent_file_chunks
  <indices.recovery.max_concurrent_file_chunks>` setting.

- Allow user to control how table data is stored and accessed on a disk
  via the :ref:`store.type <table_parameter.store_type>` table parameter and
  :ref:`node.store.allow_mmap <node.store_allow_mmap>` node setting.

- Changed the default table data store type from ``mmapfs`` to ``hybridfs``.

- Added ``phonetic`` token filter with following encoders: ``metaphone``,
  ``double_metaphone``, ``soundex``, ``refined_soundex``, ``caverphone1``,
  ``caverphone2``, ``cologne``, ``nysiis``, ``koelnerphonetik``,
  ``haasephonetik``, ``beider_morse``, ``daitch_mokotoff``.

- Removed a restriction for predicates in the ``WHERE`` clause involving
  partitioned by columns which could result in a failure response with the
  message ``logical conjunction of the conditions in the WHERE clause which
  involve partitioned columns led to a query that can't be executed``.

- Added a dynamic bulk sizing mechanism that should prevent ``INSERT INTO ...
  FROM query`` operations to run into out of memory errors if the individual
  records of a table are very large.

- Improved resiliency of ``ALTER TABLE ADD`` operation.

- Improved resiliency of ``ALTER TABLE`` operation.

- Extended :ref:`CONCAT <scalar_concat>` to do implicit casts, so that calls
  like ``SELECT 't' || 5`` are supported.

- Added the :ref:`INTERVAL <interval_data_type>` datatype and extended
  :ref:`table-functions-generate-series` to work with timestamps and the
  new :ref:`INTERVAL <interval_data_type>` type

- Added the :ref:`PG_TYPEOF <pg_typeof>` system function.

- Support implicit object creation in update statements. E.g. ``UPDATE t SET
  obj['x'] = 10`` will now implicitly set ``obj`` to ``{obj: {x: 10}}`` on rows
  where ``obj`` was previously ``null``.

- Added :ref:`LPAD <scalar-lpad>` and :ref:`RPAD <scalar-rpad>` scalar functions.

- Added the :ref:`table_parameter.codec` parameter to :ref:`ref-create-table`
  to control the compression algorithm used to store data.

- Added :ref:`AT TIME ZONE <timestamp-at-time-zone>` syntax.

- Added the :ref:`cluster.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node
  <cluster.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node>` setting.

- Added :ref:`TIMEZONE <scalar-timezone>` scalar function.

- Added support for the filter clause in
  :ref:`aggregate expressions <aggregate-expressions>` and
  :ref:`window functions <window-function-call>` that are
  :ref:`aggregates <aggregation>`.

- Added support for `offset PRECEDING` and `offset FOLLOWING`
  :ref:`window definitions <window-definition>`.

- Added support for using :ref:`ref-values` as top-level relation.

- Added an optimization that allows to run `WHERE` clauses on top of
  derived tables containing :ref:`table functions <ref-table-functions>`
  more efficiently in some cases.

- Statements containing limits, filters, window functions or table functions
  will now be labelled accordingly in :ref:`sys-jobs-metrics`.

- Added support for the :ref:`named window definition <named-windows>`.
  It allows a user to define a list of window definitions in the
  :ref:`sql_reference_window` clause that can be referenced in :ref:`over`
  clauses.

- Add support for ``ROWS`` frame definitions in the context of window functions
  :ref:`window definitions <window-definition>`.

- The ``node`` argument of the :ref:`REROUTE <alter_table_reroute>` commands of
  :ref:`ref-alter-table` can now either be the id or the name of a node.

- Added a :ref:`PROMOTE REPLICA <alter_table_reroute>` sub command to
  :ref:`ref-alter-table`.

- Added support for the :ref:`lag <window-function-lag>` and
  :ref:`lead <window-function-lead>` window functions as enterprise features.

- Changed the default for :ref:`sql_ref_write_wait_for_active_shards` from
  ``ALL`` to ``1``. This will improve the out of box experience as it allows a
  subset of nodes to become unavailable without blocking write operations. See
  the documentation for more details about the implications.

- Added left and right scalar functions.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed the handling of array values when used in the ``SET GLOBAL`` statement.

- Fixed evaluation of generated columns when they are based on columns
  with default constraints and no user given values. Default
  contraints where not taken into account before.

- Fixed an issue when using ``try_cast('invalid-ts' as timestamp)``
  which resulted in a parsing exception instead of an expected
  ``NULL`` value.

- Improved the handling of ``NULL`` values in ``SET GLOBAL`` statement. They
  now no longer cause a ``NullPointerException`` but instead advice users to
  use ``RESET GLOBAL`` to reset settings to their default value.

- Tuned the circuit breaker mechanism to reduce the change of it rejecting
  queries under low cluster load.

- Closed some gaps in the memory accounting used for the circuit breaker
  mechanism. This should help prevent memory intense queries from triggering
  long GC pauses as they'll be rejected earlier.

- Made the documented :ref:`indices.breaker.total.limit
  <indices.breaker.total.limit>` setting public, so that it can be adjusted
  using :ref:`SET GLOBAL <ref-set>`.

- Improved the migration logic for partitioned tables which have been created
  in CrateDB 2.x. If all current partitions of a partitioned tables have been
  created in CrateDB 3.x, the table won't have to be re-indexed anymore to
  upgrade to CrateDB 4.0+. 

- Changed the error message returned when a :ref:`CREATE REPOSITORY
  <ref-create-repository>` statement fails so that it includes more information
  about the cause of the failure.
