  Note that the storage of the ``numeric`` data type is not supported.

- Added information about the shards located on the node to the
  :ref:`NodeInfo MXBean <node_info_mxbean>` which is available as an
  enterprise feature.

- Added the ``to_char`` scalar function for timestamp, interval and numeric types.

- Added the ``delimiter`` option for :ref:`copy_from` CSV files. The option is
  used to specify the character that separates columns within a row.

  If the option is enabled, all column's values represented by an empty string,
  including a quoted empty string, are set to ``NULL``.

- Added the :ref:`sys.snapshot_restore <sys-snapshot-restore>` table to track the
  progress of the :ref:`snapshot restore <snapshot-restore>` operations.

- Added support for using the optimized primary key lookup plan if additional
  filters are combined via ``AND`` operators.

- Improved the performance of queries on the ``sys.allocations`` table in cases
  where there are filters restricting the result set or if only a sub-set of
  the columns is selected.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could result in a ``The assembled list of
  ParameterSymbols is invalid. Missing parameters.`` error if using the
  ``MATCH`` predicate and parameter placeholders within a query.
