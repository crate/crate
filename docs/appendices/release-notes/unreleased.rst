Breaking Changes
================

None


Deprecations
============

- The table setting :ref:`sql-create-table-soft-deletes-enabled` has been
  marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Soft deletes
  will become mandatory in CrateDB 5.0.

Changes
=======

- Added support for restoring metadata and settings from snapshots.  If ``ALL``
  is used, everything (tables, settings, views, etc.) will be restored. On the
  other hand, using ``TABLES`` will only restore tables.  In previous releases,
  only tables could be restored, even if ``ALL`` was used.

- Added the :ref:`pg_postmaster_start_time() <scalar_pg_postmaster_start_time>`
  scalar function.

- Improved language selection, translations and general usability at the
  Admin UI.

- Updated the bundled JDK to 16+36

- Optimized how ``NULL`` values are stored, reducing the amount of disk space
  required. This can also improve the performance of value lookups on tables
  with a lot of null values.

- Added the ``regclass`` data type for improved compatibility with PostgreSQL
  tools.

- Relicensed all enterprise features under the Apache License 2.0 and removed
  licensing related code. The ``SET LICENSE`` statement can still be used, but
  it won't have any effect.

- Added an empty ``pg_tablespace`` table in the ``pg_catalog`` schema for
  improved support for PostgreSQL tools.

- Improved the error messages for cast errors for values of type ``object``.

- Added support for the :ref:`CREATE TABLE AS <ref-create-table-as>` statement.

- Added :ref:`CURDATE` and :ref:`CURRENT_DATE` :ref:`scalar` functions.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that led to a ``CircuitBreakingException`` when using the
  ``ANALYZE`` statement.

- Fixed an issue that led to ``Values less than -1 bytes`` errors if ``TRACE``
  logging was activated for the circuit breaker package.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a stuck ``INNER JOIN`` query involving the
  ``sys.shards`` table on a cluster without user tables.

- Fixed shard allocation on downgraded nodes where only the ``HOTFIX`` version
  part differs to fully support rolling downgrades to same ``MAJOR.MINOR``
  versions.

- Adjusted ``crate.bat`` to work with spaces in directory names.

- Adjusted ``crate-node`` auxiliary program to use the bundled Java runtime.

- Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` when trying to kill a job as normal user
  which is no longer running.
