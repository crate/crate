.. release is being cut, changes will be moved to the appropriate release notes
.. file.

.. When resetting this file during a release, leave the headers in place, but
.. add a single paragraph to each section with the word "None".

.. Always cluster items into bigger topics. Link to the documentation whenever feasible.
.. Remember to give the right level of information: Users should understand
.. the impact of the change without going into the depth of tech.

Fixes
=====

.. If you add an entry here, the fix needs to be backported to the latest
.. stable branch. You can add a version label (`v/X.Y`) to the pull request for
.. an automated mergify backport.

- Fixed an issue that led to file not found errors when trying to restore a
  snapshot that was taken after a table had been swapped. A new snapshot
  must be taken to apply the fix and solve the issue.
