Fixes
=====

- Fixed a bug that would lead to insertion of records via ``INSERT INTO ...
  (SELECT ... FROM ..)`` and ``INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)``  into different
  partitions while using the same partition by value. This occurs only when
  the partition key is an object field of the :ref:`timestamp
  <timestamp_data_type>` data type.

- Fixed an issue that caused subscript expressions on top of child relations in
  which an object column is selected to fail.

- Fixed an issue in :ref:`ref-values` that would not allow combining expressions
  that can be explicitly casted or `NULL` literals in the same column.

- Fixed a `ClassCastException` that occurred when querying certain columns from
  ``information_schema.tables``, ``sys.jobs_log`` or ``sys.jobs_metrics`` with
  a client connected via PostgreSQL wire protocol.

- Fixed a regression introduced in ``4.0.11`` which caused a
  ``ClassCastException`` when querying ``sys.allocations``.
