Changes
=======

- Added support for using the optimized primary key lookup plan if additional
  filters are combined via ``AND`` operators.

- Improved the performance of queries on the ``sys.allocations`` table in cases
  where there are filters restricting the result set or if only a sub-set of
  the columns is selected.

Fixes

  functions.
