    In development. 5.9.9 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.9.10.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.8 release before moving to
    5.9.10.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.8.x to 5.9.10 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that would lead to errors when attempting to select a
  sub-column from a virtual table or view participating in a join, e.g.::

    SELECT vw1.col2['arr']
    FROM (SELECT * FROM tbl1) as vw1
    INNER JOIN tbl2 on vw1.col1 = tbl2.col1
    LIMIT 10;
