Changelog
=========

Deprecations
------------

 - Multicast discovery has been deprecated in this release, and will be removed
   in the 1.1 release. Multicast discovery is disabled by default.

Changes
-------

 - Return correct affected row count instead of throwing an exception when
   trying to bulk insert values that don't match the column type(s).

 - Removed ``OVER`` support from SQL parser because the clause was completely
   ignored when executing the query which led to misleading results.

 - Queries with ``_doc`` reference comparison (e.g. ``_doc['name'] = 'foo'``)
   in the ``WHERE`` clause return the correct results instead of empty result.

 - Dynamically added string columns now have exactly the same characteristics
   as string columns created via ``CREATE TABLE`` or ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN``

 - Updated crate-admin to ``1.0.4`` which includes the following change:

     - Fixed getting started display issue on very wide screens.

Fixes
-----

 - Scalar functions are now allowed on the ``HAVING`` clause if the scalar
   function is used as a ``GROUP BY`` symbol.

 - Fixed an issue in the PostgreSQL protocol that could cause a
   ``StackOverflow`` exception due to connection errors or malfunctioning
   clients.

 - Closing a connection via the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol now correctly closes
   the internal resources.

 - Fixed issue that led to casting exception when comparing an object column
   with an object literal that contains a string value.

 - Fixed and issue that caused ``UPDATE`` statement on an empty partitioned
   table to throw ``UnsupportedOperationException``.

 - Fixed an issue that caused fulltext search with ``fuzziness='AUTO'`` to
   throw ``NumberFormatException``.

 - Fixed an issue in the ``LIKE`` predicate which prevented from using escaped
   backslash before the wildcard.

 - Fixed an issue that caused ``ORDER BY`` clause to be ignored if used in
   combination with ``GROUP BY`` in subselects. e.g.::

       SELECT x from (SELECT * from t1) as tt
       GROUP BY x ORDER BY x
