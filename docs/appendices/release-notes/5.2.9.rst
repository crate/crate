Version 5.2.9
=============

Released on 2023-09-22.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.2.9.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.1 release before moving to
    5.2.9.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.1.x to 5.2.9 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that led to file not found errors when trying to restore a
  snapshot that was taken after a table had been swapped. A new snapshot
  must be taken to apply the fix and solve the issue.
