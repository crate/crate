.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.9.3 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.9.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.8 release before moving to
    5.9.3.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.8.x to 5.9.3 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.9 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused error to be thrown when attempting to access a
  nested field of an :ref:`OBJECT <type-object>`, which contains also arrays of
  :ref:`OBJECT <type-object>`, e.g.::

      SELECT {"o"=[{"oo"={"x"= 10}}, {"oo"={"x"= 20}}]}['o']['oo']['x']

- Fixed an issue that prevented to cast an array of :ref:`TEXT <type-text>`
  containing JSON text representation values to an array of
  :ref:`OBJECT <type-object>`.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``ClassCastExceptions`` or invalid results when
  the ``WHERE`` clause contained comparisons of different data types. For
  example::

      SELECT * FROM t WHERE a < 128;
      SQLParseException[Cannot cast `128` of type `integer` to type `byte`]

      SELECT * FROM t WHERE float_col = 0.99999999;
      +-----------+
      | float_col |
