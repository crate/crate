    In development. 5.5.3 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.


.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.5.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.4 release before moving to
    5.5.3.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.4.x to 5.5.3 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a regression introduced in 5.3.0 that caused storing an object as
  ``NULL`` if object had generated sub-columns and the object column wasn't
  part of the ``INSERT`` targets. An object with generated sub-columns is
  stored now.
