.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.6.0 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.


.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.6.0.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.5 release before moving to
    5.6.0.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.5.x to 5.6.0 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

.. _5.6.0_breaking_changes:

Breaking Changes
================

- When :ref:`restoring a snapshot <sql-restore-snapshot>`, ``USERS`` and
  ``PRIVILEGES`` keywords, used to restore user management metadata has been
  replaced by ``USERMANAGEMENT``, which dictates that all users and roles of the
  database together with their privileges are restored. Restoring ``USERS`` or
  ``PRIVILEGES`` separately is not possible anymore.

Deprecations
============

- ``USERS`` and ``PRIVILEGES`` keywords, used when
  :ref:`restoring a snapshot <sql-restore-snapshot>`, in order to restore users
  and privileges metadata respectively, have been deprecated. They have been
  replaced by ``USERMANAGEMENT`` and their behavior has been modified, please
  see :ref:`Breaking Changes <5.6.0_breaking_changes>` for details.

Changes
=======

SQL Statements
--------------

- Added support for explicit :ref:`NULL <null_constraint>` column constraint
  definitions in ``CREATE TABLE`` statements.

- Added support for named ``PRIMARY KEY`` constraints.

- Extended the :ref:`EXPLAIN <ref-explain>` statement to support the ``VERBOSE``
  option.

- Added support for
  :ref:`ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN <sql-alter-table-rename-column>` statement.

SQL Standard and PostgreSQL Compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- Added an empty ``pg_catalog.pg_depend`` table.

- Changed ``pg_catalog.pg_roles`` table to be properly populated, as previously
  it was always returning ``0`` rows.

- Added support of optional ``ESCAPE`` parameter to
  :ref:`LIKE and ILIKE <sql_dql_like>` operators.

Data Types
----------

- Introduced the BKD-tree-based indexing strategy for :ref:`geo_shape <data-types-geo-shape>`.

Scalar and Aggregation Functions
--------------------------------

None

Performance and Resilience Improvements
---------------------------------------

- Added an optimizer rule ``optimizer_move_limit_beneath_join`` which
  reduces the number of intermediate rows created when a ``LIMIT`` clause is
  used in combination with a left/right/cross ``JOIN`` operator, by moving
  the limit beneath the join.

- Added an optimizer rule ``optimizer_move_limit_beneath_union`` which
  reduces the number of intermediate rows created when a ``LIMIT`` clause is
  used in combination with a ``UNION`` operator, by moving the limit beneath
  the union operator e.g.::

    SELECT a FROM t1 UNION ALL SELECT b FROM t2 LIMIT 10;

- Reduced the amount of disk reads necessary for ``ANALYZE`` operations.

- Improved filter push-down for left/right outer joins when the joins are
  nested e.g.::

    SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM a LEFT JOIN b ON a.a = b.b LEFT JOIN c ON b.b = c.c) t WHERE b > 1;
  
  Now, the above query will result in the following logical plan ::

    NestedLoopJoin[LEFT | (b = c)] (rows=unknown)
      ├ HashJoin[(a = b)] (rows=unknown)
      │  ├ Collect[doc.a | [a] | true] (rows=unknown)
      │  └ Collect[doc.b | [b] | (b > 1)] (rows=unknown)
      └ Collect[doc.c | [c] | true] (rows=unknown)

Administration and Operations
-----------------------------

- Allowed un-indexed columns or columns without doc-values to be queryable.

- Added the new options ``schema_rename_pattern``,
  ``schema_rename_replacement``, ``table_rename_pattern`` and
  ``table_rename_replacement`` to :ref:`RESTORE SNAPSHOT<sql-restore-snapshot>`
  to allow renaming tables during restore.

- Added :ref:`sys.roles<sys-roles>` table which contains all database roles
  defined in the cluster.

- Added ``parents`` column to :ref:`sys.users<sys-users>` table which lists the
  roles granted to a user, together with the user that granted each role.
