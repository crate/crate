.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.7.4 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.7.4.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.6 release before moving to
    5.7.4.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.6.x to 5.7.4 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.7 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that would add a whitespace character at the beginning of some
  lines in the files containing the rows which are exported by executing
  :ref:`COPY TO<sql-copy-to>` using the local filesystem on a whole partitioned
  table.

- Changed the behavior of :ref:`LIKE and ILIKE <sql_dql_like>` operators to
  throw an error, when the pattern to match ends with the ``ESCAPE`` character.
  Previously, the ``ESCAPE`` character was ignored, and the result was computed
  based on the rest of the pattern.

- Fixed an issue that caused an ``IndexOutOfBoundsException`` when the
  :ref:`max_by <aggregation-max_by>` aggregation was called with a literal
  as searchfield parameter instead of a column e.g.::

    SELECT MAX_BY(x, 1) from tbl;

- Fixed an issue that caused write operations to fail if the table contained
  generated columns with a cast to ``geo_shape``.

- Fixed a rare race condition that could lead to queries appearing stuck and
  eventually time out after 60 seconds if they were executed while a shard was
  being created. This could happen right after a table or a partition is
  created, during shard relocation or node restarts.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to ``ANALYZE`` over account the number of
  documents in a table if shards were relocating.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``WHERE`` clause to fail to filter rows when
  the clause contained array scalar functions under ``NOT`` operator. The
  affected scalars include :ref:`scalar-array_min`, :ref:`scalar-array_max`,
  :ref:`scalar-array_sum`, :ref:`scalar-array_avg`, :ref:`scalar-array_upper`,
  :ref:`scalar-array_lower` and :ref:`scalar-array_length`.
