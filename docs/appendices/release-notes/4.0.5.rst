.. _version_4.0.5:

=============
Version 4.0.5
=============

Released on 2019/09/19.

.. NOTE::

    Please consult the :ref:`v4.0.0-upgrade-notes` before upgrading from
    CrateDB 3.x or earlier.  Before upgrading to 4.0.5 you should be running a
    CrateDB cluster that is at least on 3.0.7.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.3 release before moving to
    4.0.5.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_4.0.2`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior CrateDB 3.x will not function with 4.x and
    must be recreated before moving to 4.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.
