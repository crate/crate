.. _version_2.1.5:

=============
Version 2.1.5
=============

Released on 2017/08/14.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB
    :ref:`version_1.1.3` or higher before you upgrade to 2.1.5.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be :ref:`version_2.1.0`.  If you want to upgrade from a version
    prior to this, the upgrade will introduce all of the breaking changes listed
    for :ref:`version_2.1.0`, and will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    Consult the upgrade notes for :ref:`Version 2.1.0
    <version_2.1.0_upgrade_notes>` when upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========

Fixes
-----

  - Fixed an issue that caused the ``cluster.name`` setting in ``crate.yml``
    file to be overridden by default name ``crate``.

  - Fixed a null pointer exception when using explicit join conditions with
    fields which were not contained in the select list. For example::

      SELECT t3.z FROM t1
      JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.b
      JOIN t3 ON t2.b = t3.c
