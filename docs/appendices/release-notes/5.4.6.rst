.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.4.6 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.4.6.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.3 release before moving to
    5.4.6.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.3.x to 5.4.6 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.4 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused queries with a ``NOT (a AND b)`` expression
  in the where-clause to not evaluate correctly with null values.

- Fixed an issue that caused queries with a ``NOT`` or ``!=`` on a ``CASE``
  expression containing a nullable column to exclude ``NULL`` entries.

- Fixed an issue that caused the hash-join operator generate invalid hashes which
  lead to a broken join operation when there were more than two relations
  involved e.g.:::

    SELECT * FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE t3.c = t1.a AND t3.c = t2.b AND t1.a = t2.b;

  would generate the logical plan:::

    HashJoin[(t3.c = t2.b AND t1.a = t2.b)]
      ├ HashJoin[(t3.c = t1.a)]
      │  ├ Collect[doc.t3 | [c] | true]
      │  └ Collect[doc.t1 | [a] | true]
      └ Collect[doc.t2 | [b] | true]

  The hash-symbol generation for the join `t3.c = t2.b AND t1.a = t2.b` was
  broken and would not join the data.
