=============
Version 5.6.4
=============


Released on 2024-04-05.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.6.4.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.5 release before moving to
    5.6.4.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.5.x to 5.6.4 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.6 series.

Fixes
=====

- Changed :ref:`scalar-has-database-priv` and :ref:`scalar-has-schema-priv`
  functions to be registered under :ref:`postgres-pg_catalog` schema, to be
  compatible with PostgreSQL behaviour.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``LIKE`` operator matching an empty string pattern
  in ``WHERE`` clause to return invalid results, e.g.::

    SELECT * FROM t WHERE col LIKE ''
