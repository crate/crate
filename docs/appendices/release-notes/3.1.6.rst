.. _version_3.1.6:

=============
Version 3.1.6
=============

Released on 2019/02/05.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.1.6.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.0 release before moving to
    3.1.6.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_3.1.1`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.1 and must be recreated before moving to 3.1.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========


Fixes
-----

- Fixed a performance regression on ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` operations.

- Fixed a performance regression when inserting data using ``unnest()``.

- Fixed an issue where an ordered query with a specified limit that was much
  larger than the available rows would result in ``OutOfMemoryError`` even
  though the number of available rows could fit in memory.

- Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` that occurs on ``OUTER`` joins which can be
  rewritten to ``INNER`` joins and uses a :ref:`function <gloss-function>` as a
  select item.
