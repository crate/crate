.. NOTE::
    In development. 5.7.1 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.7.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.6 release before moving to
    5.7.1.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.6.x to 5.7.1 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.7 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could prevent a :ref:`sql-restore-snapshot` from
  restoring a partition if using the ``TABLE PARTITION (...)`` clause to restore
  an individual partition of a table with more than one partition column.

- Fixed an issue that allowed ``INSERT INTO`` statements to create more shards
  than allowed by :ref:`cluster.max_shards_per_node
  <cluster.max_shards_per_node>` if the statement resulted in the creation of
  many partitions at once.

- Fixed an issue that resulted on the garbage collection logging environment
  variables being ignored in Windows.

- Improved ingestion performance for partitioned tables where no primary keys
  are defined by using an append only optimized ingestion strategy. The
  performance improvement increases with the size of each shard.
