.. comment 2. Remove the NOTE below and replace with: "Released on 20XX-XX-XX."
.. comment    (without a NOTE entry, simply starting from col 1 of the line)
.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.9.0 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.


.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.9.0.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.8 release before moving to
    5.9.0.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.8.x to 5.9.0 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

.. _version_5.9.0_breaking_changes:

Breaking Changes
================

- Fixed an issue that caused ``WHERE`` clause containing ``NOT`` operator on
  an array type against a non-empty array to incorrectly filter empty arrays,
  e.g.::

      SELECT * FROM t WHERE a != [1];

  It is a breaking change because the fix causes performance degradations.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``WHERE`` clause containing
  :ref:`scalar-array_length` under ``<``, ``<=`` or ``=`` to return invalid
  results. It is a breaking change because the fix causes performance
  regressions on tables created before 5.9.0. For tables created on and after
  5.9.0, the fix has positive impact on the performance.

- Changed the return value of the concat operator to return a ``NULL`` literal
  instead of an empty string when any of the operand is ``NULL``.

- Changed the return value of :ref:`scalar-array_cat` to return a ``NULL``
  literal instead of an empty array when both arguments are ``NULL``.

- Changed the implementation of the :ref:`scalar-array_cat` to return an empty
  array of type ``ARRAY(UNDEFINED)`` when both arguments are an empty array
  instead of raising an exception.

Changes

SQL Statements
--------------

None

SQL Standard and PostgreSQL Compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- The ``proisstrict`` property of the ``pg_catalog.pg_proc`` table now returns
  true or false depending on if a function always returns null if any call
  argument is null. Before the property's value was a static ``null``.

- `Martin Stein <https://github.com/marstein>`_ added support for
  ``MILLISECOND`` unit for the :ref:`INTERVAL <type-interval>` data type.
  ``ms``, ``msec``, ``msecs``, ``millisecond`` or ``milliseconds`` can
  be used as the unit name as well.

Data Types
----------

None

Scalar and Aggregation Functions
--------------------------------

- Added :ref:`topk aggregation function <aggregation-topk>` which computes
  the k most frequent argument values and their frequencies.

- Changed :ref:`pg_get_userbyid <scalar-pg_get_userbyid>` to return the matching
  user or ``unknown`` instead of always ``crate``.

- Added support of the ``array || element`` operator as an alias for the
  :ref:`array_append(array, value) <scalar-array_append>` scalar function for
  improved compatibility with PostgreSQL.

- Added the :ref:`array_prepend(value, array) <scalar-array_prepend>` scalar
  function which prepends a value to an array. Additionally, added the
  ``value || array`` operator as an alias to the new
  :ref:`array_prepend(value, array) <scalar-array_prepend>` scalar function.

- Added :ref:`position scalar function <scalar-position>` as alias for the
  :ref:`strpos scalar function <scalar-strpos>`.

Performance and Resilience Improvements
---------------------------------------

None

Administration and Operations
-----------------------------

- Added support to set :ref:`session settings <conf-session>` to a user via
  :ref:`ALTER ROLE <ref-alter-role>` statement. For details and examples see:
  :ref:`here <administration_user_management_alter_user>`.

- Added support for :ref:`Shared Access Signatures (SAS) tokens <sql-create-repo-azure-sas-token>`
  as an alternative for authentication for :ref:`Azure repositories <sql-create-repo-azure>`.

- Added ``id``, ``reason``, ``total_shards`` and ``include_global_state``
  columns to the :ref:`sys.snapshots <sys-snapshots>` table.
