4.6 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue from ``COPY FROM`` that caused the tables' default expressions
  to be evaluated only once, causing a single value to be used throughout the
  table instead of per row. This only affected non-deterministic functions such
  as ``gen_random_text_uuid()``, ``random()``, etc.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to errors when reading translog files from
  CrateDB versions < 4.0.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to an ``Couldn't create execution plan`` error
  when using a join condition referencing multiple other relations.

- Fixed an issue that led to an ``Invalid query used in CREATE VIEW`` error if
  using a scalar subquery within the query part of a ``CREATE VIEW`` statement.

- Fixed an issue that caused truncation of milliseconds in ``timezone`` scalar
  function.

- Fixed an issue that caused a failure when a window function over a partition
  is not used in an upper query. For example:
  ``select x from (select x, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY y) from t) t1``

- Fixed an incorrect optimization of comparison function arguments for explicit
  cast arguments resulting in a wrong result set. Example:
  ``WHERE strCol::bigint > 3``
