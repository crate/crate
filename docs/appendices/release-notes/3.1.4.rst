.. _version_3.1.4:

=============
Version 3.1.4
=============

Released on 2018/12/19.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.1.4.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.0 release before moving to
    3.1.4.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_3.1.1`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.1 and must be recreated before moving to 3.1.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========


Fixes
-----

- ``array_unique`` and ``array_difference`` now work for nested arrays and
  arrays with objects which contain arrays.

- Fixed an issue that could cause some types of statements to remain listed
  within ``sys.jobs`` if their execution stopped with a failure.

- Fixed an issue which caused ``EXPLAIN`` statements to use a wrong ``routing``
  entries representation on versions >= 3.1.0.
