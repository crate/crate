.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.4.8 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.4.8.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.3 release before moving to
    5.4.8.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.3.x to 5.4.8 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Security Fixes
==============

- Fixed a security issue where any CrateDB user could read/import the content of
  any file on the host system, the CrateDB process user has read access to, by
  using the ``COPY FROM`` command with a file URI. This access is now restricted
  to the ``crate`` superuser only.
