See the :ref:`version_4.1.0` release notes for a full list of changes in the
4.1 series.


Fixes
=====

- Improved the resiliency of ``INSERT INTO ..`` queries that have a :ref:`table
  function <table-functions>` like ``generate_series`` as a source.

- Fixed a regression introduced in 4.1 that led to a ``ClassCastException``
  running queries with ``GROUP BY``, no aggregations, and a ``LIMIT`` clause.
