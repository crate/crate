.. _version_3.1.1:

=============
Version 3.1.1
=============

Released on 2018/09/25.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.1.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.0 release before moving to
    3.1.1.

    You cannot perform a `rolling upgrade`_ to this version. Any upgrade to
    this version will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.1 and must be recreated before moving to 3.1.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.
