.. _version_4.2.0:

=============
Version 4.2.0
=============

Released on 2020-07-07.

.. NOTE::

    If upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher before
    you upgrade to 4.2.0.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 4.1 release before moving to
    4.2.0.

    A rolling upgrade from 4.1.7+ to 4.2.0 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Breaking Changes
================

- Changed the logic how the ``array_unique`` scalar infers the argument types.
  Previously if the arguments had a different type it used the type of the
  first argument. For example::

    cr> select array_unique(['1'], [1.0, 2.0]);
    +---------------------------------+
    | array_unique(['1'], [1.0, 2.0]) |
    +---------------------------------+
    | ["1", "1.0", "2.0"]             |
    +---------------------------------+

  This logic has been changed to instead use a type precedence logic to be
  consistent with how other functions behave::

    cr> select array_unique(['1'], [1.0, 2.0]);
    +------------+
    | [1.0, 2.0] |
    +------------+
    | [1.0, 2.0] |
    +------------+

- Remap CrateDB :ref:`object_data_type` array data type from the PostgreSQL
  JSON to JSON array type. That might effect some drivers that use the
  PostgreSQL wire protocol to insert data into tables with object array typed
  columns. For instance,  when using the ``Npgsql`` driver, it is not longer
  possible to insert an array of objects into a column of the object array
  data type by using the parameter of a SQL statement that has the JSON data
  type and an array of CLR as its value. Instead, use a string array with JSON
  strings that represent the objects. See the ``Npgsql`` documentation for
  more details.

- Bulk ``INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)`` statements do not throw an exception
  any longer when one of the bulk operations fails. The result of the
  execution is only available via the ``results`` array represented by a
  row count for each bulk operation.

- Numeric literals fitting into the ``integer`` range will be detected now as
  ``integer`` literals instead of ``bigint`` literals. Thus a statement like
  ``select 1`` will return an ``integer`` column type. This shouldn't be an
  issue for most clients as the ``HTTP`` endpoint uses ``JSON`` for
  serialization and PostgreSQL clients usually use a typed ``getLong``.

- In the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol, ``ReadyForQuery`` messages now contain the
  ``IN TRANSACTION`` or ``FAILED TRANSACTION`` indicator based on previous
  ``BEGIN`` and ``COMMIT`` SQL statements. Before this change, the status
  always defaulted to ``IDLE``. This change may have the side-effect that an
  explicit ``rollback`` call in a client library will result in an unsupported
  ``ROLLBACK`` statement.

Deprecations
============

- The ``index.warmer.enabled`` setting has been deprecated and doesn't have any
  effect anymore.


Changes
=======


Administration
--------------

- The JavaScript user defined function language is now enabled by default in
  the CrateDB enterprise edition.

- Added the :ref:`optimizer <conf-session-optimizer>` session setting
  to configure query optimizer rules.

- Include the bundled version of ``OpenJDK`` (14.0.1+7) into the ``CrateDB``
  built. It means that ``CrateDB`` doesn't rely on ``JAVA_HOME`` of the host
  system any longer.

- Increased the default interval to detect ``keystore`` or ``truststore``
  changes to five minutes.

- Added a ``tables`` column to the :ref:`sys.snapshots <sys-snapshots>` table
  which lists the fully qualified name of all tables contained within the
  snapshot.

- Limit the output of COPY FROM RETURN SUMMARY in the presence of errors to
  display up to 50 ``line_numbers`` to avoid buffer pressure at clients and
  to improve readability.


SQL Standard and PostgreSQL compatibility improvements
------------------------------------------------------

- Added scalar function :ref:`CURRENT_TIME <current_time>`, that returns
  the system's time as microseconds since midnight UTC, at the time the SQL
  statement is handled. The actual return type is the new data type
  :ref:`timetz <time-data-type>`.

- Added new type :ref:`time with time zone <time-data-type>`, a.k.a `timetz`,
  which is to be used as return type for time related functions such as the
  future `current_time`.

- Added the :ref:`oidvector_type` data type which is used in some
  :ref:`postgres_pg_catalog` tables.

- Added the :ref:`oid_regproc` alias data type that is used to reference
  functions in the :ref:`postgres_pg_catalog` tables.

- Added the :ref:`varchar(n) and character varying(n) <data-type-varchar>`
  types, where ``n`` is an optional length limit.

- Added the :ref:`server_version_num <conf-session-server_version_num>` and
  :ref:`server_version <conf-session-server_version>` read-only session
  settings.

- Added the `pg_catalog.pg_proc <postgres_pg_catalog>`_ table.

- Added the `pg_catalog.pg_range <postgres_pg_catalog>`_ table.

- Added the `pg_catalog.pg_enum <postgres_pg_catalog>`_ table.

- Added the `information_schema.character_sets <character_sets>`_ table.

- Added :ref:`postgres_pg_type` columns: ``typbyval``, ``typcategory``,
  ``typowner``, ``typisdefined``, ``typrelid``, ``typndims``,
  ``typcollation``, ``typinput``, ``typoutput``, and ``typndefault`` for improved
  PostgreSQL compatibility.

- Added support for ``JOIN USING``, e.g. ``SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING
  (col)``, an alternative to ``JOIN ON``, when the column name(s) are the same
  in both relations.

- Added entries for primary keys to ``pg_class`` and ``pg_index`` table.

- Added support for :ref:`record subscript <record-subscript>` syntax as
  alternative to the existing :ref:`object subscript <object-subscript>`
  syntax.

- Added support for using columns of type ``long`` inside subscript expressions
  (e.g., ``array_expr[column]``).

- Made :ref:`generate_series <table-functions-generate-series>` addressable by
  specifying the ``pg_catalog`` schema explicitly. So, for example, both
  ``generate_series(1, 2)`` and ``pg_catalog.generate_series(1, 2)`` are valid.

- Added support for the PostgreSQL notation to refer to array types. For
  example, it is now possible to use ``text[]`` instead of ``array(test)``.

- Added support for ``GROUP BY`` operations on analysed columns of type
  ``text``.

Functions and operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed arithmetics containing a non-floating numeric column type and a
  floatling literal which resulted wrongly in a non-floating return type.

- Replaced the ``Nashorn`` JavaScript engine with ``GraalVM`` for JavaScript
  :ref:`user-defined functions <sql_administration_udf>`. This change upgrades
  ``ECMAScript`` support from ``5.1`` to ``10.0``.

- Added the :ref:`chr <scalar_chr>` scalar function.

- Added :ref:`length <scalar-length>` and :ref:`repeat <scalar-repeat>`
  scalar functions.

- Added the :ref:`array_agg <array_agg>` aggregation function.

- Added the :ref:`trunc <scalar-trunc>` scalar function.

- Added the :ref:`now <now>` scalar function.

- Added a ``mod`` alias for the :ref:`modulus <scalar-modulus>` function for
  improved PostgreSQL compatibility.

- Added the :ref:`atan2 <scalar-atan2>` trigonometric scalar function.

- Added the :ref:`exp <scalar-exp>` scalar function.

- Added the :ref:`degrees <scalar-degrees>` and :ref:`radians <scalar-radians>`
  scalar functions.

- Added support for using :ref:`table functions <ref-table-functions>` with
  more than one column within the select list part of a SELECT statement.

- Added the :ref:`cot <scalar-cot>` trigonometric scalar function.

- Added the :ref:`pi <scalar-pi>` scalar function.

- Added a ``ceiling`` alias for the :ref:`ceil <scalar-ceil>` function for
  improved PostgreSQL compatibility.

- Added the :ref:`encode(bytea, format) <scalar-encode>` and :ref:`decode(text,
  format) <scalar-decode>` string functions.

- Added the :ref:`ascii <scalar_ascii>` scalar function.

- Added the :ref:`obj_description(integer, text) <obj_description>` scalar
  function for improved PostgreSQL compatibility.

- Added the :ref:`format_type(integer, integer) <format_type>` scalar
  function for improved PostgreSQL compatibility.

- Added the :ref:`version() <version>` system information function.


New statements and clauses
--------------------------

- Extended the supported syntax for :ref:`SET TRANSACTION
  <ref-set-transaction>`.

- Added the :ref:`DISCARD <discard>` statement.

- Added the :ref:`CHECK <check_constraint>` constraint syntax, which specifies
  that the values of certain columns must satisfy a boolean expression on
  insert and update.

- Introduced new optional ``RETURNING`` clause for :ref:`INSERT <ref-insert>`
  and :ref:`UPDATE <ref-update>` to return specified values from each row
  written.

Performance improvements
------------------------

- Optimized `<column> IS NOT NULL` queries.
