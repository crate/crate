4.2 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed a regression introduced in 4.2.0 which caused :ref:`fulltext search
  <predicates_match>` queries of the ``phase`` match type to ignore the
  ``fuzziness`` option.

- Fixed a regression introduced in 4.2.0 that caused ``sum`` and ``avg``
  global aggregates to return incorrect results when used on columns of
  ``real`` or ``double precision`` data types.

- Fixed an issue that caused primary key lookups to return an empty result
  instead of the row identified by the primary key values, if the primary key
  consists of multiple columns and if one of them is of type ``BOOLEAN``.
