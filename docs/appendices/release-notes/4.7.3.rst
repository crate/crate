4.7 series.

Fixes
=====

- Enabled to alter the setting ``blocks.read_only_allow_delete`` on blob tables
  to make it possible to drop read-only blob tables.

- Fixed an issue that could cause queries on ``sys.snapshots`` to get stuck and
  consume a significant amount of resources.

- Fixed an issue with primary key columns that have a ``DEFAULT`` clause. That
  could lead to queries on the primary key column not matching the row.

- Fixed an issue with aliased sub-relation outputs when used inside the outer
  where clause expression, resulting in a planner error. Example:
  ``SELECT * FROM (SELECT id, true AS a FROM t1) WHERE a``

- Fixed an issue with table functions parameter binding in ``SELECT`` queries
  without ``FROM`` clause. Example: ``SELECT unnest(?)``.

- Fixed an issue with ``VARCHAR`` and ``BIT`` columns with a length
  limited used in primary key, generated or default column expression. An
  ``ALTER TABLE`` statement removed the length limit from such columns.
