Released on 2025-01-30.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.7.6.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.6 release before moving to
    5.7.6.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.6.x to 5.7.6 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could cause data loss if increasing the number of shards
  using ``ALTER TABLE ... SET (number_of_shards = ?)`` while having other
  allocation settings in place that prevent the shard allocation.
