Version 5.10.14
===============

Released on 2025-11-03.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.10.14.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.9 release before moving to
    5.10.14.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.9.x to 5.10.14 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.10 series.


Fixes
=====

- Improved ``WHERE`` clause analysis for queries on tables with both ``PARTITION
  BY`` and ``CLUSTERED BY`` clause to narrow the partitions and shards that are
  hit if the query filters on the ``PARTITIONED BY`` and ``CLUSTERED BY``
  columns. An example::

    CREATE TABLE tbl (x int, c int, p int) clustered by (c) partitioned by (p);
    SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE c = 1 and p = 1;

  In this case the query will only search in the partition ``p=1`` and hit a
  single shard depending on the routing for ``c=1``

- Fixed an issue resulting in stuck :ref:`sys-jobs` entries when an
  :ref:`sql-insert` statement using :ref:`ref-values` results in an execution
  error, e.g. due to implicit cast or parsing issues.

- Fixed a replication issue happening when an integral value, not fitting to
  ``INT`` or ``LONG`` types, was stored in an OBJECT with policy ``IGNORED``.
