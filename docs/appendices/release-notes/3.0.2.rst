.. _version_3.0.2:

=============
Version 3.0.2
=============

Released on 2018/06/12.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.0.2.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 2.3 release before moving to
    3.0.2.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_3.0.0`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

    Please consult the :ref:`version_3.0.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.0 and must be recreated before moving to 3.0.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========


Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue that caused an ``UnsupportedFeatureException`` to be thrown
  for queries with a ``WHERE`` clause which contains an equality comparison
  that references a table column in both sides. E.g.::

    SELECT * FROM t
    WHERE t.i = abs(t.i)

- Fixed an issue that could cause a cluster check warning, telling the user to
  upgrade tables which do not require upgrades.

- Fixed an issue that could cause ``HTTP`` requests using empty ``bulk_args``
  to fail.

- Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` which could be thrown when deleting a table
  and querying the ``size`` column from the ``sys.shards`` table.
