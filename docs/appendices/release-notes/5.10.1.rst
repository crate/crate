.. NOTE::
    In development. 5.10.1 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.10.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.9 release before moving to
    5.10.1.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.9.x to 5.10.1 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.10 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a regression from ``5.10.0`` that could get ``COPY FROM`` statements to
  get stuck if used with ``RETURN SUMMARY``

- Fixed a regression from ``5.10.0`` that caused a ``ColumnUnknownException``
  when accessing a child of an object literal from an aliased table.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a ``Scale of numeric must be less than the
  precision`` error when using the ``AVG`` aggregation in a way that involved
  values of type ``NUMERIC``.

- Fixed an issue that could cause data loss if increasing the number of shards
  using ``ALTER TABLE ... SET (number_of_shards = ?)`` while having other
  allocation settings in place that prevent the shard allocation.

- Fixed an issue that could cause duplicate records to be returned when
  filtering on a table by PRIMARY KEY, using query parameters, and binding the
  same value to them, e.g.::

    SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE pk_col = ? OR pk_col = ?
    -- Bind the same value to both query parameters

- Fixed a handshake version compatibility issue that causes a node with a
  higher major version (e.g. ``6.x``) to fail to join a cluster of version
  < :ref:`version_5.10.1` (rolling upgrade scenario).

- Fixed an issue that caused an error when using a PreparedStatement and
  selecting an expression, involving a parameter and a column used in
  ``ORDER BY`` and query had a ``LIMIT`` clause. Example.::

    SELECT a, b + ? as sum FROM tbl ORDER BY sum LIMIT 10
