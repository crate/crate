.. _version_3.3.4:

=============
Version 3.3.4
=============

Released on 2019/06/19.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.3.4.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.2 release before moving to
    3.3.4.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_3.3.0`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

    Please consult the :ref:`version_3.3.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.3 and must be recreated before moving to 3.3.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========


Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue that caused conflicting rows in an ``INSERT INTO .. ON
  CONFLICT (..) DO NOTHING`` statement to be reported as failed.

- Fixed an issue that caused wrong results when running ``LEFT`` or ``RIGHT``
  outer joins on a single node cluster and the rows inside each table differs.

- Fixed an issue in the PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation that could
  cause clients to receive a ``Only write operations are allowed in Batch
  statements`` if the client relied on the behavior that closing prepared
  statements should implicitly close related portals.

- Fixed a bug that led to ``is null`` predicates against ``ignored`` object
  fields to always :ref:`evaluate <gloss-evaluation>` to true.

- Fixed ``collect_set`` to return an ``array`` type in order to be able to
  return the results over ``JDBC``. ``collection_count`` and ``collection_avg``
  are also changed to receive ``arrays`` as arguments, instead of ``sets``.

- Fixed an issue that caused an error when trying to create a table with a
  column definition that contains a predefined array data type and
  :ref:`generated expression <ddl-generated-columns-expressions>`. For
  instance, a statement like ``CREATE TABLE foo (col ARRAY(TEXT) AS ['bar'])``
  would fail.

- Fixed a bug that led to failures of group by a single text column queries on
  columns with the cardinality ration lower than ``0.5``.
