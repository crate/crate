.. _version_4.0.4:

=============
Version 4.0.4
=============

Released on 2019/08/21.

.. NOTE::

    Please consult the :ref:`v4.0.0-upgrade-notes` before upgrading from
    CrateDB 3.x or earlier.  Before upgrading to 4.0.4 you should be running a
    CrateDB cluster that is at least on 3.0.7.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.3 release before moving to
    4.0.4.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_4.0.2`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior CrateDB 3.x will not function with 4.x and
    must be recreated before moving to 4.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

See the :ref:`version_4.0.0` release notes for a full list of changes in the
4.0 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that would lead :ref:`ref-explain` of invalid statements to
  stuck instead of fail.

- Fixed a regression introduced in 4.0 that broke the ``MATCH`` predicate if
  used on aliased relations.

- Improved error handling if an argument of a :ref:`window function
  <window-functions>` is not used as a grouping symbol.

- Fixed an ``OUTER JOIN`` issue resulting in an ``ArrayOutOfBoundException`` if
  the gap between matching rows of the tables was growing to big numbers.

- Fixed serialization issue that might occur in distributed queries that
  contain window function calls with the partition by clause in the select
  list.

- Fixed a race condition which could result in a ``AlreadyClosedException``
  when querying the ``sys.shards`` table.
