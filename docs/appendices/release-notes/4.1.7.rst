4.1 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused ``ORDER BY`` :ref:`expressions <gloss-expression>`
  referencing table functions used in the ``SELECT`` list to fail.

- Fixed an issue that prevented an optimization for ``SELECT DISTINCT
  <single_text_column> FROM <table>`` from working if used within a ``INSERT
  INTO`` statement.

- Re-enabled the IAM role authentication for :ref:`s3 repositories
  <sql-create-repo-s3>`

- Changed the required privileges to execute ``RESET`` statements to include
  the ``AL`` privilege. Users with ``AL`` could change settings using ``SET
  GLOBAL`` already.

- Fixed an issue that caused a ``NullPointerException`` if the :ref:`ANALYZE
  <analyze>` statement was executed on tables with primitive array type columns
  that contain ``NULL`` values.

- Fixed an issue that caused the ``OFFSET`` clause to be ignored in ``SELECT
  DISTINCT`` queries.
