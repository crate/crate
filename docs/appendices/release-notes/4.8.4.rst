4.8 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a file descriptor leak that was triggered by querying the ``os`` column
  of the ``sys.nodes`` table.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to stuck queries.

- Fixed ``EXPLAIN`` plan output for queries with a ``WHERE`` clause containing
  implicit cast symbols. A possible optimization of our planner/optimizer was
  not used, resulting in different output than actually used on plan execution.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a ``NoSuchElementException`` when using the
  JDBC client and mixing different DML statements using the ``addBatch``
  functionality.
