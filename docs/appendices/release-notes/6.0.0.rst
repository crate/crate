.. NOTE::
    In development. 6.0.0 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 6.0.0.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.10 release before moving to
    6.0.0.

    A rolling upgrade from >= 5.10.1 to 6.0.0 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

.. _version_6.0.0_breaking_changes:

Breaking Changes
================

- Updated Lucene from 9.12 to 10.0 which brings the following user facing changes:

  - Tables created in 4.x can't be read anymore. If you're running CrateDB 5.x
    and have any tables created in 4.x they need to be reindexed before moving
    to CrateDB 6.0. Make sure there are no warnings in the admin console and see
    :ref:`table_version_compatibility` for more information.

  - The ``dutch_kp`` and ``lovins`` token filters are no longer available. If
    users have tables which use these token filters for analysis, they will need
    to re-index with either plain ``dutch`` or ``english`` stemmers before
    upgrading.

  - The ``german2`` and ``german`` token filters now use the same underlying stemmer,
    which always expands ``ä``, ``ö`` and ``ü`` to ``ae``, ``oe`` and ``ue`` respectively.
    If users have tables which were using the ``german`` stemmer without a character
    filter that already did this, they will need to re-index after upgrading.

Deprecations
============

 - Usage of :ref:`_version<sql_administration_system_column_version>` has been
   deprecated completely. Please note that its usage for :ref:`sql_occ` has
   already been deprecated since :ref:`version_4.0.0`.

  :ref:`information_schema.enabled_roles <enabled_roles>`,
  :ref:`information_schema.administrable_role_authorizations <administrable_role_authorizations>`
  and :ref:`information_schema.role_table_grants <role_table_grants>` tables.

Data Types
