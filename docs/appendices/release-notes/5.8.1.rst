.. NOTE::
    In development. 5.8.1 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.8.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.7 release before moving to
    5.8.1.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.7.x to 5.8.1 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.8 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused write operations to fail if the table contained
  generated columns with a cast to ``geo_shape``.

- Fixed a rare race condition that could lead to queries appearing stuck and
  eventually time out after 60 seconds if they were executed while a shard was
  being created. This could happen right after a table or a partition is
  created, during shard relocation or node restarts.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to ``ANALYZE`` over account the number of
  documents in a table if shards were relocating.

- Fixed a regression introduced in 5.8.0 that led to error when running a query
  ``SELECT * FROM sys.nodes`` in a mixed cluster.

- Fixed a regression introduced in 5.8.0 that prevented cluster to become GREEN
  after a rolling upgrade.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``WHERE`` clause to fail to filter rows when
  the clause contained array scalar functions under ``NOT`` operator. The
  affected scalars include :ref:`scalar-array_min`, :ref:`scalar-array_max`,
  :ref:`scalar-array_sum`, :ref:`scalar-array_avg`, :ref:`scalar-array_upper`,
  :ref:`scalar-array_lower` and :ref:`scalar-array_length`.
