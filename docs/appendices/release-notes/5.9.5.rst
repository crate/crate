Version 5.9.5
=============


Released on 2024-12-10.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.9.5.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.8 release before moving to
    5.9.4.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.8.x to 5.9.5 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused wrong results when implicit joins were combined
  with outer-joins within the same query e.g.::

      SELECT * FROM t1, t2 RIGHT JOIN t3 ON true

- Fixed an issue leading to an error when running SELECT COUNT(*) on a Subquery
  with ``UNION ALL`` having a table on the one side and a renamed table or view
  on another. Example::

      SELECT count(*) FROM (SELECT id FROM users UNION ALL SELECT 1 as renamed) t;

- Return a proper error message when using an invalid
  :ref:`sql-create-repo-azure-endpoint` or
  :ref:`sql-create-repo-azure-secondary_endpoint` URI for defining an
  :ref:`azure repository <sql-create-repo-azure>`.
