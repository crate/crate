4.2 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue with the :ref:`quote_ident <scalar-quote_ident>` :ref:`scalar
  function <scalar-functions>` that caused it to quote :ref:`subscript
  expressions <sql-subscripts>` like ``"col['x']"`` instead of ``"col"['x']``.

- Fixed an issue that prevented the use of subscript expressions as conflict
  target in ``ON CONFLICT`` clauses of ``INSERT`` statements.

- Fixed an issue where :ref:`drop snapshot <ref-drop-snapshot>` on an
  :ref:`azure repository <sql-create-repo-azure>` would not delete all the
  related data.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a ``Field is not streamable`` error message
  when using :ref:`window functions <window-functions>`.
