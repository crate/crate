4.2 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue with the :ref:`quote_ident <scalar-quote-ident>` scalar
  function that caused it to quote subscript expressions like ``"col['x']"``
  instead of ``"col"['x']``.

- Fixed an issue that prevented the use of subscript expressions as conflict
  target in ``ON CONFLICT`` clauses of ``INSERT`` statements.

- Fixed an issue where :ref:`drop snapshot <ref-drop-snapshot>` on an
  :ref:`azure repository <ref-create-repository-types-azure>` would not delete
  all the related data.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a ``Field is not streamable`` error message
  when using window functions.
