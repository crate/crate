4.1 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that led to more than one :ref:`expression <gloss-expression>`
  in the form ``<literalValue> AS <alias>`` to be interpreted as the same
  column if all ``<literalValue>`` expressions are equal.

- Fixed an issue that led to a ``NullPointerException`` when using ``GROUP BY``
  on a nested :ref:`partition column <gloss-partition-column>`.

- Fixed an issue that led to an ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`` if using
  ``ON CONFLICT (...) UPDATE SET`` in an ``INSERT`` statement.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a ``Values less than -1 bytes are not
  supported`` error if one or more CrateDB nodes have insufficient disk space
  available.

- Fixed an issue that would cause ``COPY FROM`` statements that used a HTTPS
  source using a Let's Encrypt certificate to fail.

- Fixed an issue that caused :ref:`RTRIM <scalar-rtrim>` to behave like
  :ref:`LRTRIM <scalar-ltrim>`.
