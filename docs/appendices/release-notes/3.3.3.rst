.. _version_3.3.3:

=============
Version 3.3.3
=============

Released on 2019/05/23.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.3.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.2 release before moving to
    3.3.3.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_3.3.0`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

    Please consult the :ref:`version_3.3.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.3 and must be recreated before moving to 3.3.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========

Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue that will prevent CrateDB from bootstrapping when running on
  Java 8 and a javaagent is specificed using ``JAVA_OPTS`` or
  ``CRATE_JAVA_OPTS``.

- Fixed an issue that prevented parameter placeholders from being resolved when
  creating a view. A view definition like ``CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT ?`` would
  get stored without the ``?`` being resolved to the actual parameter value,
  causing queries on the view to fail and also breaking
  ``information_schema.views``.

- Increased the precedence of the double colon cast operator, so that a
  statement like ``x::double / y::double`` applies both casts before the
  division.

- Fixed an issue with the disk watermark sys checks which would incorrectly
  report all of them as failed if
  :ref:`cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled
  <cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled>` was set to false.

- Fixed an issue were a query on a sub-query with ambiguous columns would
  return the same values for all of the ambiguous columns. An example is
  ``SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t1, t2) AS tjoin`` where both ``t1`` and
  ``t2`` have a column named ``x``. In this case the value for ``t1.x`` would
  be output twice.

- Fixed a race condition when setting an enterprise license very early on node
  startup while a trial license is generated concurrently and such may used
  instead of the user given license.

- Improve error message for the unsupported :ref:`window-definition` ordered or
  partitioned by an array column type in the context of :ref:`window-functions`
