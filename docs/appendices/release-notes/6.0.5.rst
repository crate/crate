Version 6.0.5
=============

Released on 2025-12-11.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 6.0.5.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.10 release before moving to
    6.0.5.

    A rolling upgrade from >= 5.10.1 to 6.0.5 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.
