.. NOTE::

    In development. 6.1.1 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 6.1.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 6.0 release before moving to
    6.1.1.

    A rolling upgrade from >= 6.0.2 to 6.1.1 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could cause a ``ALTER TABLE`` operation changing the
  number of shards of a table to interrupt a concurrent ``ALTER TABLE``
  operation also changing the number of shards.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a deadlock when executing a statement
  containing a ``JOIN`` that got executed using a hash join algorithm on a
  cluster with more than one node.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``EXPLAIN ANALYZE`` on queries using a sub-query
  returning multiple-rows (like with ``WHERE x IN (SELECT ...)``) to not release
  the memory accounted within the query circuit breaker. This could later on
  result in queries getting rejected with a circuit breaker exception, despite
  having memory available.

- Fixed an issue where generated and default sub-columns were missing from
  results returned by the ``RETURNING`` clause.

- Fixed an issue that led to deleting persisted
  :ref:`pg_catalog.pg_stats <pg_stats>` during full cluster restart, thus making
  it necessary to run again :ref:`analyze`.

- Disallowed generated sub-columns within object arrays or referencing their
  sub-columns, which is unsupported and leading to errors or wrong behavior.

- Fixed an issue with ``atttypid`` column of the ``pg_attribute`` table not
  being reset to ``0`` for dropped columns, which contradicts with the
  PostgreSQL behavior.

- Fixed an issue resulting in stuck :ref:`sys-jobs` entries when an
  :ref:`sql-insert` statement using :ref:`ref-values` results in an execution
  error, e.g. due to implicit cast or parsing issues.

- Fixed an issue causing ``SELECT *`` or ``ANALYZE`` statements to fail with an
  error ``unexpected docvalues type... Re-index with correct docvalues type.``
  if a column was added into restored table.

- Fixed an issue resulting in broken :ref:`administration-logical-replication`
  when subscribing to clusters running versions < :ref:`version_6.1.0`.

- Fixed a translog recovery issue, happening when a ``NULL`` value was stored
  in an :ref:`type-object` with policy :ref:`type-object-columns-ignored` on
  tables created before :ref:`version 5.5.0 <version_5.5.0>`.
  To mitigate the issue, run CrateDB with a CLI option
  ``-Des.xcontent.strict_duplicate_detection=false``. Please note, that this
  flag has a global effect, and it's recommended to set it back to the default
  value ``true`` once invalid records are processed. Issue can be considered
  as mitigated when ``translog_stats['uncommitted_size']`` in the
  :ref:`sys.shards <sys-shards>` table stops exceeding
  :ref:`flush_threshold_size <sql-create-table-translog-flush-threshold-size>`.

- Fixed an issue causing a ``GROUP BY ... LIMIT 0`` statement to not release
  it's accounted memory on the ``QUERY`` circuit breaker.
