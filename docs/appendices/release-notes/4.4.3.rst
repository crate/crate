Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that led to a ``CircuitBreakingException`` when using the
  ``ANALYZE`` statement.

- Fixed an issue that led to ``Values less than -1 bytes`` errors if ``TRACE``
  logging was activated for the circuit breaker package.

- Fixed :ref:`shard allocation <gloss-shard-allocation>` on downgraded nodes
  where only the ``HOTFIX`` version part differs to fully support rolling
  downgrades to same ``MAJOR.MINOR`` versions.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a stuck ``INNER JOIN`` query involving the
  ``sys.shards`` table on a cluster without user tables.

- Adjusted ``crate.bat`` to work with spaces in directory names.

- Adjusted ``crate-node`` auxiliary program to use the bundled Java runtime.

- Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` when trying to kill a job as normal user
  which is no longer running.
