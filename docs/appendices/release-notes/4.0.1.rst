.. _version_4.0.1:

=============
Version 4.0.1
=============

Released on 2019/07/08.

.. NOTE::

    Please consult the :ref:`v4.0.0-upgrade-notes` before upgrading.
    Before upgrading to 4.0.1 you should be running a CrateDB cluster that is
    at least on 3.0.7.

    An upgrade to :ref:`version_4.0.1` requires a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.


.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior CrateDB 3.x will not function with 4.x and
    must be recreated before moving to 4.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

4.0 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed a possible NPE which could occur when querying the ``sys.allocations``
  table.

- Fixed the tables compatibility check to correctly indicate when tables need
  to be recreated in preparation for a CrateDB upgrade towards the next major
  version of CrateDB.

- Fixed an issue that led to ``DEFAULT`` constraints of inner columns of object
  columns to be ignored.

- The values provided in ``INSERT`` or ``UPDATE`` statements for object columns
  which contain :ref:`generated expressions
  <ddl-generated-columns-expressions>` are now validated. The computed
  expression must match the provided value. This makes the behavior consistent
  with how top level columns of a table are treated.

- Fixed support for ordering by literal constants.  Example: ``SELECT 1, * FROM
  t ORDER BY 1"``
