.. _version_5.2.3:

=============
Version 5.2.3
=============

Released on 2023-02-23.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.2.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.1 release before moving to
    5.2.3.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.1.x to 5.2.3 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.2 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused correlated sub-queries to fail if using columns in
  the filter clause that were otherwise not selected.

- Fixed an issue that caused correlated sub-queries to fail with an
  ``IllegalStateException`` when the outer query contained multiple joins.
  An example ::

    CREATE TABLE a (x INT, y INT, z INT); // tables b, c, d created as a
    SELECT
      (SELECT 1 WHERE a.x=1 AND b.y=1 AND c.z=1)
    FROM a, b, c, d;
    IllegalStateException[OuterColumn `y` must appear in input of
    CorrelatedJoin]

- Fixed an issue that caused ``DROP FUNCTION`` to throw a
  ``ColumnUnknownException`` instead of an ``IllegalArgumentException``
  justifying why a function cannot be dropped.

- Updated to Admin UI 1.24.3, which fixed a compatibility issue where graphs
  have not been working on the "Overview" page with CrateDB 5.2, and added
  syntax highlighting for functions added in CrateDB 5.2: ``MIN_BY``,
  ``MAX_BY``, ``HAS_DATABASE_PRIVILEGE``, ``PARSE_URI``, and ``PARSE_URL``.
