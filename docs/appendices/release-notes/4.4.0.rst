Changes
=======

Performance improvements
------------------------

- Improved the performance of queries on the ``sys.health`` table.

- Added support for using the optimized primary key lookup plan if additional
  filters are combined via ``AND`` :ref:`operators <gloss-operator>`.

- Improved the performance of queries on the ``sys.allocations`` table in cases
  where there are filters restricting the result set or if only a sub-set of
  the columns is selected.

- Improved the performance for queries which select a subset of the columns
  available in a wide table.

SQL and PostgreSQL compatibility improvements
---------------------------------------------

- Added :ref:`arithmetic operation <arithmetic>` support for the :ref:`numeric
  <numeric_type>` type.

- Added support for the :ref:`numeric <numeric_type>` data type and allow the
  ``sum`` aggregation on the :ref:`numeric <numeric_type>` type.
  Note that the storage of the ``numeric`` data type is not supported.

- Extended the ``RowDescription`` message that can be sent while communicating
  with PostgreSQL clients to include a ``table_oid`` and a ``attr_num`` based
  on the values that are also exposed via the ``pg_catalog.pg_attribute``
  table. This improves compatibility with clients which make use of these
  attributes.

- Changed the :ref:`format_type <format_type>` function to use the PostgreSQL
  compatible type name notation with ``[]`` suffixes for arrays, instead of
  ``_array``.

- Added the ``delimiter`` option for :ref:`sql-copy-from` CSV files. The option
  is used to specify the character that separates columns within a row.

- Added the ``empty_string_as_null`` option for :ref:`sql-copy-from` CSV files.
  If the option is enabled, all column's values represented by an empty string,
  including a quoted empty string, are set to ``NULL``.


Administration and Operations
-----------------------------

- Added information about the shards located on the node to the :ref:`NodeInfo
  MXBean <node_info_mxbean>` which is available as an enterprise feature.

- Added the :ref:`sys.snapshot_restore <sys-snapshot-restore>` table to track
  the progress of the :ref:`snapshot restore <snapshot-restore>` operations.


New scalar and window functions
-------------------------------

- Added the :ref:`to_char <scalar-to_char>` scalar function for ``timestamp``
  and ``interval`` argument data types.

- Added the :ref:`split_part <scalar-split_part>` scalar function.

- Added the :ref:`dense_rank <window-function-dense_rank>` window function,
  which is available as an enterprise feature.

- Added the :ref:`rank <window-function-rank>` window function, which is
  available as an enterprise feature.
