Version 5.9.11
==============

Released on 2025-02-27.


.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.9.11.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.8 release before moving to
    5.9.11.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.8.x to 5.9.11 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.
