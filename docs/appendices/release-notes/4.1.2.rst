Fixes
=====

- Fixed a regression that caused a ``ArithmeticException: / by zero`` error
  when querying an empty table or a non-empty table with outdated table
  statistics.

- Fixed a regression that caused ``INSERT INTO`` statements containing an
  ``object`` column as target and a matching JSON string literal in the source
  to fail with a type cast error.

- Fixed an issue which may result in showing the CE Admin UI view even if
  running in Enterprise mode on early node startup.
