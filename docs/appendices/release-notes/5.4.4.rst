.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.4.4 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.4.4.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.3 release before moving to
    5.4.4.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.3.x to 5.4.4 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that led to file not found errors when trying to restore a
  snapshot that was taken after a table had been swapped. A new snapshot
  must be taken to apply the fix and solve the issue.

- Fixed an issue that caused nested accesses to ``ignored`` objects with
  unknown object keys from returning non ``nulls``. For example::

    SELECT o['a']['unknown'] FROM t;

  returning the value for ``o['a']`` instead of a ``null``.

- Fixed a regression introduced with CrateDB 5.3.1 which caused a
  ``NullPointerException`` when creating a repository on S3 with authentication
  provided by IAM role attached to the EC2 instance running the CrateDB node.

- Fixed an issue with missing validation on ``INSERT`` statement, allowing to
  specify duplicate target columns.
