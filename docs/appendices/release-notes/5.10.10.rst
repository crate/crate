.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.10.10 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.10.10.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.9 release before moving to
    5.10.10.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.9.x to 5.10.10 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.10 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that would cause error to be thrown when selecting a column
  of :ref:`type-timestamp-without-tz` or :ref:`type-timestamp-with-tz` for
  which, the :ref:`ddl-storage-columnstore` is disabled.

- Fixed a race condition that could lead to ``INSERT INTO`` statements with a
  ``ON CONFLICT`` clause to either take much longer than necessary or get stuck
  unless other activity caused cluster change events.

- Fixed an issue that caused queries with aggregations to get stuck under
  memory pressure.

- Fixed an issue that caused RAM under-accounting, potentially leading to an
  ``OutOfMemoryError`` when result sets contained numeric values with large
  digit counts. The issue affected ``HTTP`` requests only.

- Fixed an issue that caused queries with aggregations to continue despite
  ``CircuitBreakerException`` being thrown and return incorrect (partial)
  results under memory pressure.
