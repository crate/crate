Version 5.4.3
=============

Released on 2023-09-05.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.4.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.3 release before moving to
    5.4.3.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.3.x to 5.4.3 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a regression introduced with CrateDB 5.0.0 which can cause that some
  nested join queries using the hash-join algorithm will return empty results
  after table statistics have been collected and the join order is optimized.
