.. NOTE::
    In development. 5.10.3 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.10.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.9 release before moving to
    5.10.3.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.9.x to 5.10.3 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.10 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that would prevent users with ``DDL`` privilege on ``CLUSTER``
  level, to execute :ref:`DROP ANALYZER<drop-analyzer>`, thus before the fix,
  only allowing the ``crate`` superuser to execute ``DROP ANALYZER`` statements.

- Fixed an issue that caused a :ref:`float vector <type-float_vector>` column
  to be created with length exceeding the maximum.

- Fixed an issue that prevented the use of custom analyzers with
  :ref:`shingle token filters<shingle-tokenfilter>`.

- Fixed an issue that would prevent usage of a column with a custom
  :ref:`ANALYZER <ref-create-analyzer>` which has been added to a table with
  :ref:`ADD COLUMN <sql-alter-table-add-column>`. The fix doesn't apply for
  columns which were already added to tables after their creation before
  :ref:`version_5.10.3`. Those columns need to be dropped and recreated.

- Fixed a regression introduced in :ref:`version_5.10.0` that
  caused tables become unavailable after ``ALTER TABLE RENAME`` statements
  followed by a cluster restart.
