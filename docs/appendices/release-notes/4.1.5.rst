Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused ``COPY FROM`` from a ``HTTPS`` URL to fail with
  ``No X509TrustManager implementation available`` if CrateDB is configured to
  use ``SSL``.

- Fixed an issue that would lead to incorrect result when selecting the
  :ref:`cluster license <sys-cluster-license>` object column, namely, the
  fields of the object would contain null values, even though the license
  was set.

- Fixed an issue that caused a ``OFFSET`` as part of a ``UNION`` to be applied
  incorrectly.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to incorrect ordering of a result sets if
  using ``ORDER BY`` on a column of type ``IP`` or on a scalar function.

- Fixed an issue that caused a ``NullPointerException`` if using ``COPY TO``
  with a ``WHERE`` clause with filters on primary key columns.
