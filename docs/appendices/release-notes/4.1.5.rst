Released on 2020-04-24.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 4.1.5.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 4.0 release before moving to
    4.1.5.

    A rolling upgrade to 4.1.5 from 4.0.2+ is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

4.1 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused ``COPY FROM`` from a ``HTTPS`` URL to fail with
  ``No X509TrustManager implementation available`` if CrateDB is configured to
  use ``SSL``.

- Fixed an issue that would lead to incorrect result when selecting the
  ``cluster license`` object column from ``sys.cluster``: fields of the
  object would contain null values even though the license was set.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``OFFSET`` as part of a ``UNION`` to be applied
  incorrectly.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to incorrect ordering if using ``ORDER BY`` on
  a column of type ``IP`` or on a :ref:`scalar function <scalar-functions>`.

- Fixed an issue that caused a ``NullPointerException`` if using ``COPY TO``
  with a ``WHERE`` clause with filters on primary key columns.
