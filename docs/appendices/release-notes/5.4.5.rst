.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.4.5 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.4.5.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.3 release before moving to
    5.4.4.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.3.x to 5.4.5 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused querying on un-indexed columns to return empty
  results. The expected behaviour was to have an exception thrown but as part
  of this fix, un-indexed columns as well as columns without doc-values are now
  queryable.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``UNION`` to throw ``SQLParseExceptions`` instead
  of ``AmbiguousColumnExceptions``, when 2 or more columns are assigned the
  same name. e.g.::

    SELECT a FROM (SELECT a, b AS a FROM t UNION SELECT 1, 1) t2;
    -- selecting 'a' from 't2' is ambiguous since there are 'a' and 'b AS a'
