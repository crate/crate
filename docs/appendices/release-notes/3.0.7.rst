.. _version_3.0.7:

=============
Version 3.0.7
=============

Released on 2018/09/25.

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
   before you upgrade to 3.0.7.

   We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 2.3 release before moving to
   3.0.7.

   If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
   number must be at least :ref:`version_3.0.0`. Any upgrade from a version
   prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

   When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
   on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

   Please consult the :ref:`version_3.0.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.0 and must be recreated before moving to 3.0.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

.. WARNING::

   Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========


Breaking Changes
----------------

- Previously, :ref:`version_3.0.0` advertised a breaking change for the removal
  of the ``region`` setting when using the ``CREATE REPOSITORY`` query for S3
  based snapshot repositories. However, due to a bug, using the ``region``
  setting was valid syntax in versions 3.0.0 through to 3.0.6.

  This bug has been fixed in 3.0.7. Due to this, ``CREATE REPOSITORY`` queries
  that were accepted (erroneously) in 3.0.6 may no longer work in 3.0.7.


Fixes
-----

- Calling an unknown :ref:`user-defined function <user-defined-functions>` now
  results in an appropriate error message instead of a
  ``NullPointerException``.

- Trying to create a table with a generated column inside an object column now
  results in a friendly error message instead of a ``NullPointerException``.

- Fixed processing of the ``endpoint``, ``protocol`` and ``max_retries`` S3
  repository parameters.
