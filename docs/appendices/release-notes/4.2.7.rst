Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that allowed users to create a self-referencing view which
  broke any further operations accessing table meta data.

- Prevent dropping of a UDF if it is still used inside any
  :ref:`generated column expressions <ddl-generated-columns-expressions>`,
  throw an error instead.
