.. comment 2. Remove the NOTE below and replace with: "Released on 20XX-XX-XX."
.. comment    (without a NOTE entry, simply starting from col 1 of the line)
.. NOTE::

    In development. 6.2.1 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 6.2.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 6.1 release before moving to
    6.2.1.

    A rolling upgrade from >= 6.1.2 to 6.2.1 is supported. Doing a rolling
    upgrade from an earlier version than 6.1.2 can cause runtime errors when
    executing statements relying on implicit casts.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused under-accounting of memory usage of some queries
  stored in cache. It affected cache eviction that is depending on query memory
  usage, potentially leading to an ``OutOfMemoryError``.

- Fixed an issue that allowed inserting ``NULL`` values into child columns of
  ``ARRAY(OBJECT)`` columns despite ``NOT NULL`` constraint on those child
  columns if a sibling column had a value.

- Fixed an issue with users being able to execute
  :ref:`user defined functions <user-defined-functions>`, even if they lacked
  privileges on the schema under which a ``UDF`` is defined. Now ``DQL``
  :ref:`privilege <administration-privileges>` on the schema is required.
