.. NOTE::
    In development. 5.10.2 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.10.2.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.9 release before moving to
    5.10.2.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.9.x to 5.10.2 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.10 series.

Fixes
=====

- The ``status`` field within the JSON payload returned from the HTTP root
  endpoint ``(/)`` now shows 503 instead of 200 if the cluster state is
  considered unavailable to match how the ``ok`` field behaves.

- Fixed an issue where a filter was not pushed down to the source when the
  filtered column was aliased as part of a view. This could lead to an
  unnecessary full table scan.

- Fixed a regression introduced in ``5.6.5`` that caused empty partitions to be
  left behind when ``DELETE`` condition contained a non-deterministic function
  such as ``NOW()``, e.g.::

    DELETE FROM t WHERE day < now() - INTERVAL '3 days';

  where 'day' is ``TIMESTAMP`` type that is also the ``PARTITIONED BY`` column.
