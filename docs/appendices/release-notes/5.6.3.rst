.. NOTE::
    In development. 5.6.3 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.6.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.5 release before moving to
    5.6.3.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.5.x to 5.6.3 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.6 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could cause ``SHOW CREATE TABLE`` on a missing table to
  mention similarly named tables, despite the user not having any permissions on
  those tables.

- Fixed an issue that caused wrong results to be returned for queries for which
  the ``WHERE`` clause includes a :ref:`PK <primary_key_constraint>` column and
  a non-:ref:`PK <primary_key_constraint>` column under an ``OR`` operator,
  e.g.::

    SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE pk_col = 1 OR other_col = 'foo'

- Fixed an issue with PostgreSQL style :ref:`INTERVALs <type-interval>`, which
  allowed duplicate unit definitions, e.g.::

     SELECT '1 year 3 days 2 years'::INTERVAL

- Fixed an issue with PostgreSQL style :ref:`INTERVALs <type-interval>`, which
  didn't allow units next to values without whitespace separation, e.g.::

     SELECT '1year 2weeks 3day'::INTERVAL

- Fixed an issue with PostgreSQL style :ref:`INTERVALs <type-interval>`, which
  caused issues for interval strings with extra white spaces, e.g.::

     SELECT ' @ 1 year 2 weeks 3 days ago '::INTERVAL

- Fixed an issue with PostgreSQL style :ref:`INTERVALs <type-interval>`, which
  didn't recognize the ``ago`` keyword when in mixed-case or uppercase, e.g.::

     SELECT '@ 1 year 2 weeks 3 days AGO'::INTERVAL

- Fixed an issue with PostgreSQL style :ref:`INTERVALs <type-interval>`, which
  caused weeks to be ignored if days are also present in the string, e.g.::

     SELECT '1 year 2 weeks 3 days'::INTERVAL

- Fixed parsing of PostgreSQL style :ref:`INTERVALs <type-interval>`, by
  restricting the tokens allowed for the interval units. For example,
  previously, the following string would be parsed correctly::

     SELECT '1 yearrrrrr 2 weekend 10dayyyyyy'::INTERVAL

- Fixed an issue with PostgreSQL style :ref:`INTERVALs <type-interval>`, which
  didn't allow the interval units to be upper or mixed case, e.g.::

     SELECT '1 yeAR 2 WeeKs 3 DAYS'::INTERVAL

- Fixed an issue that caused ``CrateDB`` to fail to notify client applications
  connecting via :ref:`PostgreSQL Wire Protocol <interface-postgresql>` that
  :ref:`standard_conforming_strings <conf-session-standard_conforming_strings>`
  is set to ``on`` which caused the clients to treat all query strings as non
  standard conforming.

- Fixed ``NullPointerException`` thrown when joining tables with ``USING``
  clause which contains columns not existing in either or both tables.
