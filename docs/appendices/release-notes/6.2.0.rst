.. NOTE::

    In development. 6.2.0 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 6.2.0.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 6.1 release before moving to
    6.2.0.

    A rolling upgrade from >= 6.1.0 to 6.2.0 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Changes
=======

SQL Statements
--------------

None

SQL Standard and PostgreSQL Compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- Columns names prefixed with an underscore are now accepted, although their use
  is still discouraged to avoid conflicts in case future CrateDB versions
  introduce additional system columns.

- Added support for selecting more than one column within a subquery used in a
  ``EXISTS`` clause.

Data Types
----------

None

Scalar and Aggregation Functions
--------------------------------

None

Performance and Resilience Improvements
---------------------------------------

- Changed the ``SWAP TABLE`` sub-command of :ref:`ALTER CLUSTER
  <ref-alter-cluster>` to no longer re-allocate the shards of the swapped table.
  This avoids breaking pending snapshots with a SWAP TABLE operation.
