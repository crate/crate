.. _version_4.0.2:

=============
Version 4.0.2
=============

Released on 2019/07/12.

.. NOTE::

    Please consult the :ref:`v4.0.0-upgrade-notes` before upgrading.
    Before upgrading to 4.0.2 you should be running a CrateDB cluster that is
    at least on 3.0.7.

    An upgrade to :ref:`version_4.0.2` requires a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.


.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior CrateDB 3.x will not function with 4.x and
    must be recreated before moving to 4.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue in the Admin UI that prevented partitions from showing up in
  the table detail view.

- Fixed an issue in the version handling that would prevent rolling upgrades to
  future versions of CrateDB.

- Arithmetic operations now work on :ref:`expressions <gloss-expression>` of
  type :ref:`timestamp without time zone <data-types-dates-times>`, to make it
  consistent with ``timestamp with time zone``.
