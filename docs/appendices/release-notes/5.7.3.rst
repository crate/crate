.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.7.3 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.7.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.6 release before moving to
    5.7.3.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.6.x to 5.7.3 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.7 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused snapshots in progress to not be shown in the
  ``sys.snapshots`` table.

- Fixed an issue that caused queries to incorrectly filter out rows when the
  ``WHERE`` clause contained :ref:`scalar-format_type` function under ``NOT`` or
  ``!=`` operators.

- Fixed an issue that resulted in an ``unsupported ExecutionNode`` error if
  joining a foreign table with another table that's sharded across many nodes.

- Fixed an issue that prevented sub-columns of a view to be shown in the
  ``information_schema.columns`` table if only top-level columns were used in
  the view's SELECT query. Workaround: explicitly select sub-columns in the
  view definition, e.g.::

      CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT a, a['b'] FROM t;

- Fixed an issue that caused ``SQLParseException`` when a
  :ref:`PostgreSQL foreign table <administration-fdw-jdbc-psql>` has columns of
  type ``JSONB``, or ``JSONB[]``.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``WHERE`` clause to fail to filter rows when
  the clause contained :ref:`scalar-pg_get_partkeydef` scalar function under
  ``NOT`` operator.

- Changed :ref:`scalar-pg_get_function_result` functions to be registered under
  :ref:`postgres-pg_catalog` schema, in order to be compatible with PostgreSQL
  behaviour.

- Fixed an issue leading to incorrect results joining tables with a ``=`` and
  on either side (or both) of the equality there is ``=`` or ``!`` operator and
  multiple relations involved, e.g.::

      SELECT * from t1 JOIN t2 ON (t1.a >= 1) = ((t1.a = t1.a) AND (t2.b <= t2.b))
