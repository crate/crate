.. _version_4.0.3:

=============
Version 4.0.3
=============

Released on 2019/08/06.

.. NOTE::

    Please consult the :ref:`v4.0.0-upgrade-notes` before upgrading.
    Before upgrading to 4.0.3 you should be running a CrateDB cluster that is
    at least on 3.0.7.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.3 release before moving to
    4.0.3.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_4.0.2`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior CrateDB 3.x will not function with 4.x and
    must be recreated before moving to 4.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue with using the same column under a different name/alias inside
  more complex queries. Example: ``SELECT count(*), t.x, t.x AS tx FROM t GROUP
  BY t.x``

- Fixed an issue with the ``collect_set`` function. It could compute an
  incorrect result if used as a :ref:`window function <window-functions>` with
  shrinking window frames.

- Fixed an issue with the version payload returned by HTTP, which resulted in
  falsely displaying CrateDB's version as a ``-SNAPSHOT`` version at the
  Admin UI.

- Fixed parsing of timestamps with a time zone offset of ``+0000``.

- Fixed an issue that could cause startup to fail with early access builds of
  Java.
