.. NOTE::

    In development. 6.1.2 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 6.1.2.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 6.0 release before moving to
    6.1.2.

    A rolling upgrade from >= 6.0.2 to 6.1.2 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

series.

Fixes
=====

- Added forward compatibility for cast function representation used in CrateDB
  6.2.0+. As a side effect this also improves the performance of implicit casts.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``SELECT COUNT(NULL) FROM tbl`` to return one
  record per row in the table instead of a single row with value ``0``.

- Fixed a hash collision issue resulting in some unmatched rows not being
  returned when using a ``LEFT JOIN`` query with an equal join condition.
  Example::

    SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
