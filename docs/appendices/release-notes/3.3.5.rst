.. _version_3.3.5:

=============
Version 3.3.5
=============

Released on 2019/07/08.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.3.5.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.2 release before moving to
    3.3.5.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_3.3.0`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

    Please consult the :ref:`version_3.3.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.3 and must be recreated before moving to 3.3.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========


Fixes
-----

- Fixed the tables compatibility check to correctly indicate when tables need
  to be recreated in preparation for a CrateDB upgrade towards the next major
  version of CrateDB.

- The values provided in ``INSERT`` or ``UPDATE`` statements for object columns
  which contain :ref:`generated expressions
  <ddl-generated-columns-expressions>` are now validated. The computed
  expression must match the provided value. This makes the behavior consistent
  with how top level columns of a table are treated.

- Fixed support for ordering by literal constants.

  Example: ``SELECT 1, * FROM t ORDER BY 1"``
