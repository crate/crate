.. _version_4.0.8:

=============
Version 4.0.8
=============

Released on 2019/11/07.

.. NOTE::

    Please consult the :ref:`v4.0.0-upgrade-notes` before upgrading from
    CrateDB 3.x or earlier.  Before upgrading to 4.0.8 you should be running a
    CrateDB cluster that is at least on 3.0.7.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.3 release before moving to
    4.0.8.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_4.0.2`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior CrateDB 3.x will not function with 4.x and
    must be recreated before moving to 4.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

4.0 series.

Fixes
=====

- Improved the handling of sorted queries with a large limit, to reduce the
  chance of them causing a out of memory error.

- Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` that could occur when querying the
  ``settings`` column of ``information_schema.table_partitions``.

- Fixed an issue in the Admin interface that caused the pagination ``Previous``
  button to not display the whole list of results for that page in the console
  view.

- Fixed an issue that could prevent ``CREATE SNAPSHOT`` from succeeding,
  resulting in a partial snapshot which contained failure messages incorrectly
  indicating that the index is corrupt.

- Fixed an issue resulting in a parsing exception on ``SHOW TABLE`` statements
  when a default :ref:`expression <gloss-expression>` is implicitly cast to the
  related column type and the column type contains a ``SPACE`` character (like
  e.g. ``double precision``).
