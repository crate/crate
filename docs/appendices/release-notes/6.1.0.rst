.. NOTE::

    In development. 6.1.0 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 6.1.0.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.10 release before moving to
    6.1.0.

    A rolling upgrade from >= 5.10.1 to 6.1.0 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Breaking Changes
================

- Changed the datatype and values returned from ``is_nullable`` column of
  :ref:`information_schema.columns <information_schema_columns>` table.
  Previously, it was returning ``BOOLEAN`` values, and now it returns ``'YES'``
  or ``'NO'``, in order to be compatible with the SQL specification.

- Changed behavior of relative paths defined for :ref:`path.conf <path.conf>`,
  :ref:`path.data <path.data>`, :ref:`path.repo <path.repo>` and
  :ref:`path.logs <path.logs>`, to use the value of
  :ref:`CRATE_HOME <conf-env-crate-home>` as the basis directory, against which
  the relative paths are resolved, thus conforming to the behavior already
  described in the :ref:`documentation <conf-node-settings_paths>`.
