See the :ref:`version_4.2.0` release notes for a full list of changes in the
4.2 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed a performance regression that caused ``SELECT`` statements on tables
  with generated :ref:`partition columns  <gloss-partition-column>` and a
  predicate that uses a column used to compute the partition column to hit all
  partitions instead of only a subset.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a ``IndexOutOfBoundsException`` when using
  virtual tables and joins.

- Fixed an issue that declared the rule optimizer settings as global. The
  settings are now session local.

- Fixed an issue that prevented the ``MATCH`` predicate from working in mixed
  clusters running 4.1.8 and 4.2.

- Fixed an issue that prevented user defined functions in a custom schema from
  working if used in a generated column expression.

- Fixed an issue that allowed users to use a function in a generated column
  that didn't fully match the given arguments, leading to a subsequent runtime
  failure when trying to access tables.

- Fixed exposure of the full qualified name of a sub-script column in
  `information_schema.tables.partitioned_by` and
  `pg_catalog.pg_attribute.attname` to use the CrateDB SQL compatible identifier.

- Fixed an issue that led to a ``Message not fully read`` error when trying to
  decommission a node using ``ALTER CLUSTER DECOMMISSION``.

- Fixed an issue that resulted in incorrect results when querying the
  ``sys.nodes`` table. Predicates used in the ``WHERE`` clause on columns that
  were absent in the select-list never matched.
