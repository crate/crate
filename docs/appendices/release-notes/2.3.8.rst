Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused a ``NullPointerException`` when using ``ANY`` on
  timestamp columns.

- Fixed an issue that resulted in an unusable partitioned table when at least
  one column was defined with an explicit ``COLUMNSTORE`` setting.

- Fixed an issue that would cause ``count(*)`` to return the wrong count when
  applied to a :ref:`subquery <gloss-subquery>`.

- Fixed an issue that could cause ``JOIN`` queries with ``ORDER BY`` to return
  incorrect results.

  fail.
