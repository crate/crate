Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue inside the table version and node version compatibility check
  which prevented downgrading from one hotfix version to another one.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to a ``String index out of range`` error when
  streaming values of type ``TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`` using a PostgreSQL
  client.

- Fixed an issue that could lead to errors like ``Can't map PGType with oid=26
  to Crate type`` using a PostgreSQL client.

- Fixed an issue that could result in a ``The assembled list of
  ParameterSymbols is invalid. Missing parameters.`` error if using the
  ``MATCH`` predicate and parameter placeholders within a query.

- Bumped JNA library to version 5.6.0. This will make CrateDB start flawlessly
  and without warnings on recent versions of Windows.
