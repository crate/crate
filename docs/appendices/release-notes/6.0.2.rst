.. _version_6.0.2:

=============
Version 6.0.2
=============

Released on 2025-09-24.

... NOTE::

     If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
     before you upgrade to 6.0.2.

     We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.10 release before moving to
     6.0.2.

     A rolling upgrade from >= 5.10.1 to 6.0.2 is supported.
     Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

 .. WARNING::

     Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
     and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

     You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
     `inserting the data into a new table`_.

series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could lead to PostgreSQL wire protocol messages being sent
  in the wrong order to the client. The issue was triggered when using batched
  statements where one of the statements caused a parse or bind error.

- Fixed a regression introduced in :ref:`version_6.0.0`. When upgrading
  from a ``5.x`` cluster it changed metadata for blob tables in a way that
  is not forward compatible with 6.1.
