.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.9.6 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.9.6.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.8 release before moving to
    5.9.6.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.8.x to 5.9.6 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.9 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a performance issue in transaction log replay, where the TranslogIndexer object was being
  recreated for each operation rather than being shared between all operations on a shard.

- Fixed a possible deadlock where concurrent delete requests could take a lock but then never
  release it, leading to requests timing out and threads parked in infinite waits.

- Fixed a regression introduced with :ref:`version_5.6.0` which caused the
  :ref:`percentile() <aggregation-percentile>` aggregation function to return
  results with high deviations for some data sets and data distribution. By the
  added support for passing in an optional 3rd ``compression`` parameter to the
  :ref:`percentile() <aggregation-percentile>` aggregation function, the
  accuracy of the result can be now controlled and adjusted to the user's needs.
  Be aware that higher ``compression`` values will lead to slightly higher memory
  consumption.
