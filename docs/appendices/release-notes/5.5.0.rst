.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.5.0 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.


.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.5.0.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.4 release before moving to
    5.5.0.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.4.x to 5.5.0 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Changes
=======

SQL Statements
--------------

- Changed the ``CREATE TABLE`` analysis to be more strict. Before it was
  possible to use unqualified names in place of string literals to define values
  within ``WITH`` clauses. Now string literals are required.

  For example, instead of::

    my_column text index using fulltext with (analyzer = myanalyzer)

  It is necessary to use::

    my_column text index using fulltext with (analyzer = 'myanalyzer')


- Changed ``CREATE TABLE`` to allow defining ``CHECK`` constraints inline on
  sub-columns of object columns. Before it was necessary to use table check
  constraints.


SQL Standard and PostgreSQL Compatibility
-----------------------------------------

None

Data Types
----------

- Added a :ref:`FLOAT_VECTOR <type-float_vector>` type to store dense vectors of
  float values which can be searched using a k-nearest neighbour algorithm via a
  new :ref:`KNN_MATCH <scalar_knn_match>` scalar.


Scalar and Aggregation Functions
--------------------------------

- Added a :ref:`KNN_MATCH <scalar_knn_match>` scalar.
