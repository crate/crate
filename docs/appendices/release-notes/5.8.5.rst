.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.8.5 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.8.5.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.7 release before moving to
    5.8.5.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.7.x to 5.8.5 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.8 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that would lead to wrong results being returned when trying to
  match a column of type :ref:`CHAR<type-char>` with string literals in the
  ``WHERE`` clause.

- Fixed an issue that would cause users and roles to loose irrelevant
  privileges, like: ``Administration Language (AL)``, when a table or a view
  is dropped.

- Improved the memory accounting for values of type ``geo_shape`` to avoid
  running into out of memory errors or higher than expected GC load when running
  queries like ``INSERT INTO ... (query)``.

- Fixed a regression introduced in 5.8.4 leading to a rejection of writes into
  a column of the ``OBJECT(IGNORED)`` type if it had an array sub-column with
  mixed types.

- Fixed an issue resulting in different (and partly wrong)
  ``sys.allocations.decisions`` results when querying the table on different
  nodes.

- Fixed an incorrect optimization of comparison operators in combination with
  array subscript expression, :ref:`ANY <sql_any_array_comparison>`,
  :ref:`ARRAY_UPPER <scalar-array_upper>` and
  :ref:`ARRAY_LENGTH <scalar-array_length>` function argument whereas the array
  (or array element) column has an explicit cast. Such queries may return wrong
  results as the explicit cast was removed. Example:

  ``WHERE my_array[1]::timestamptz > 3::timestamptz``
