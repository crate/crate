Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue where ``access_key`` and ``secret_key`` settings for :ref:`s3
  repositories <sql-create-repo-s3>` were exposed as unmasked settings.

- Fixed an issue that would prevent the :ref:`pg_stats <pg_stats>` table from
  querying if the ``most_common_vals`` or ``histogram_bounds`` columns contain
  values of the ``OBJECT`` or ``ARRAY`` types.
