4.6 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a performance regression introduced in 4.2 which caused queries with a
  ``LIMIT`` on top of views or virtual tables with an ``ORDER BY`` to be slow.

- Fixed an issue in the ``Query View`` function of the administration console.
  It generated queries with extra quotes around identifiers.

- Fixed an issue that could cause clients to receive a ``400 Bad Request``
  error when using the HTTP interface early during node startup.

- Fixed an issue that resulted in broken values when selecting multiple object
  columns with different inner types using the ``UNION`` statement.

- Fixed an issue which caused object data types definitions with sub-column
  identifiers containing white spaces to result in a validation exception
  at CrateDB ``4.6.2`` or a unusable object type column (write/reads fail)
  at CrateDB ``4.2.0`` to ``4.6.1``.
