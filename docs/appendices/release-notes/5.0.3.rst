Version 5.0.3
=============

Released on 2022-10-18.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.0.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 4.8 release before moving to
    5.0.3.

    A rolling upgrade from 4.8.x to 5.0.3 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue which caused ``PRIMARY KEY`` columns to be required on insert
  even if they are generated and their source columns are default not-null,
  i.e.::

    CREATE TABLE test (
      id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      created TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT current_timestamp NOT NULL,
      month TIMESTAMP GENERATED ALWAYS AS date_trunc('month', created) PRIMARY KEY
    );

    INSERT INTO test(id) VALUES(1);

- Fixed an issue that could cause ``COPY FROM``, ``INSERT INTO``,
  ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` operations to get stuck if under memory pressure.

- Fixed an issue that didn't allow queries with a greater than ``0`` ``OFFSET``
  but without ``LIMIT`` to be executed successfully, i.e.::

    SELECT * FROM test OFFSET 10
    SELECT * FROM test LIMIT null OFFSET 10
    SELECT * FROM test LIMIT ALL OFFSET 10

- Fixed an issue that caused ``col IS NULL`` to match empty objects.
