==============
Version 5.2.10
==============

Released on 2023-10-12.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.2.10.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.1 release before moving to
    5.2.10.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.1.x to 5.2.10 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.2 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused privileges checks to be bypassed when using scalar
  sub-selects in various clauses of a query: ``SELECT``, ``WHERE``, ``HAVING``,
  etc.

- Fixed an issue that led to file not found errors when trying to restore a
  snapshot that was taken after a table had been swapped. A new snapshot
  must be taken to apply the fix and solve the issue. This issue was not fully
  addressed with :ref:`version_5.2.9`.
