Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue that leads to an exception if the statement :ref:`evaluates
  <gloss-evaluation>` on arrays that are provided in an :ref:`aggregation
  function <aggregation-functions>`.

- Fixed a performance regression that could cause ``JOIN`` queries to execute
  slower than they used to.

- Return proper exception when group by is used on :ref:`scalar functions
  <scalar-functions>` that are applied to an aggregation.

- Fixed an issue that causes aliases used in the select list to get lost on
  :ref:`subselect <gloss-subquery>` queries.

- The correct error messages and codes are now thrown for REST actions.

- Fixed an issue that could cause non-grouping aggregations on virtual tables
  to return the wrong result.

- Fixed a bug in the memory accounting of the circuit breaker for HTTP results
  when querying ``GEO_SHAPE`` columns.

- Reflect internally used default size for ``translog.flush_threshold_size``
  also in documentation and expose the correct default value in table
  settings.
