Fixes
-----

 - Fixed an issue that leads to an exception if the statement :ref:`evaluates
   <gloss-evaluation>` on arrays that are provided in an :ref:`aggregation
   function <aggregation-functions>`.

 - Fixed a performance regression that could cause ``JOIN`` queries to execute
   slower than they used to.

 - Return proper exception when group by is used on :ref:`scalar functions
   <scalar-functions>` that are applied to an aggregation.

 - Fixed an issue that causes aliases used in the select list to get lost on
   :ref:`subselect <gloss-subquery>` queries.

 - The correct error messages and codes are now thrown for REST actions.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause non-grouping aggregations on virtual tables
   to return the wrong result.

 - Fixed a bug in the memory accounting of the circuit breaker for HTTP results
   when querying ``GEO_SHAPE`` columns.

 - Reflect internally used default size for ``translog.flush_threshold_size``
   also in documentation and expose the correct default value in table
   settings.
