.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.8.4 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::
    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.8.4.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.7 release before moving to
    5.8.4.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.7.x to 5.8.4 is supported.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.8 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue causing an object column definition with duplicate child
  column names to be accepted (last definition was used) instead of throwing an
  error. E.g.::

      CREATE TABLE tbl (obj OBJECT AS (a BOOLEAN, a INTEGER));

- Fixed an issue that caused filtering by :ref:`ANY <sql_any_array_comparison>`
  operator on an array typed column under an explicit cast to return invalid
  results.

- Fixed an issue that caused filtering by :ref:`ALL <all_array_comparison>`
  operator on :ref:`REAL <type-real>` array columns against literals to return
  invalid results.

- Fixed an issue that caused cast to :ref:`NUMERIC <type-numeric>` to return
  incorrect results, with missing ``scale``. This issue has only affected
  multi-node cluster installations.

- Fixed an integer overflow issue when the total shards (shards and replicas)
  configured for a table are greater than ``Integer.MAX_VALUE``.
