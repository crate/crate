4.6 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could lead to ``NULL`` values getting returned when using
  a ``_doc['columnName']`` expression in the ``ORDER BY`` clause.
  Prior to 4.6.0 this also affected ``INSERT INTO`` statements on top level
  columns.

- Fixed an issue that caused a class cast error when trying to import records
  from a ``CSV`` file into a partitioned table using the ``COPY FROM``
  statement.

- Fixed an issue that caused a node with default configuration to fail on
  startup with error "No valid auth.host_based entry found".
