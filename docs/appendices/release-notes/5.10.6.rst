==============
Version 5.10.6
==============

Released on 2025-05-12.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.10.6.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.9 release before moving to
    5.10.6.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.9.x to 5.10.6 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

5.10 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could lead to ``null`` values getting returned on
  subscript expressions on ``array(object)`` columns - for example when used as
  expression inside a ``INDEX`` definition::

      create table t (
        obj object as (details array(object as (names text[]))),
        index ft using fulltext (obj['details']['names'])
      )


- ``LIKE ANY`` now behaves the same as any other operators used with ``ANY`` and
  automatically levels the dimensions by wrapping the right side in an
  ``array_unnest`` as necessary - as documented.

- Fixed a bug where references to a column initially created in versions of CrateDB
  before 5.5 would return ``NULL`` instead of their actual value when the column was
  addressed via ``doc['column']``
