    In development. 6.1.3 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 6.1.3.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 6.0 release before moving to
    6.1.3.

    A rolling upgrade from >= 6.0.2 to 6.1.3 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

See the :ref:`version_6.1.0` release notes for a full list of changes in the 6.1
series.

Fixes
=====

- Changed :ref:`hyperloglog_distinct <aggregation-hyperloglog-distinct>` to return
  ``0`` instead of ``NULL`` if using a ``FILTER`` clause that doesn't match any
  records - to be consistent with a global ``WHERE`` and ``COUNT``.

- Fixed a regression introduced in :ref:`version_6.1.0` that could lead to
  mixing partial success results with error message in the response from the
  ``HTTP`` endpoint.

- Fixed an issue causing memory leaks if requests to the ``HTTP`` endpoint
  failed due to a missing :ref:`HBA <admin_hba>` entry or wrong credentials.

- Fixed an issue that caused direct memory under-accounting, potentially leading
  to an ``OutOfMemoryError`` when a large result set was returned by the
  ``HTTP`` endpoint.

- Fixed a regression introduced with :ref:`version_6.0.0` that led to wrong
  results when mixing ``CROSS JOIN`` and ``INNER JOIN`` on a condition with a
  :ref:`CASE<scalar-case-when-then-end>` referring to one of the cross joined
  tables. e.g.::

    SELECT * FROM t1, t0
    INNER JOIN (SELECT 1 AS col0) AS sub0
    ON (CASE sub0.col0 WHEN sub0.col0 THEN t0.c0 ELSE false END)
