.. _version_3.0.4:

=============
Version 3.0.4
=============

Released on 2018/07/23.

.. NOTE::

   If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
   before you upgrade to 3.0.4.

   We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 2.3 release before moving to
   3.0.4.

   If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
   number must be at least :ref:`version_3.0.0`. Any upgrade from a version
   prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

   When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
   on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

   Please consult the :ref:`version_3.0.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.0 and must be recreated before moving to 3.0.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

.. WARNING::

   Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========

Fixes
-----

- Fixed an issue which prevented adding new string typed columns into dynamic
  objects if a cluster was initially created with a version between
  ``1.1.0`` and ``2.0.0``.

- Fixed an issue that caused runtime changes to the
  ``indices.breaker.query.limit`` and ``indices.breaker.query.overhead``
  settings to be ignored when using the ``SET GLOBAL [TRANSIENT]`` command.

- Stored the correct name (``timestamptz``) for the timestamp type in the
  ``pg_type`` table.

- Fixed an issue that caused an ``UnsupportedFeatureException`` to be thrown
  when deleting or updating by query on an empty partitioned table, instead of
  just returning 0 rows deleted/updated.
