Fixes
=====

- Updated ``log4j`` to 2.15.0 to fix a security vulnerability. See `Log4Shell
  <https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/>`_ for details.

- Fixed an issue that could result in an error if a client sent multiple
  statements in a single string using the PostgreSQL simple protocol mode.

- Improved the detection of the cgroup version to support kernels where the
  `cpu.stat` and `memory.stat` files weren't available at the cgroup root
  level.

- Fixed an issue that could cause a deadlock, leading to an unavailable cluster
  if using blob tables and uploading multiple files in parallel.

- Fixed an issue that was triggered by adding a column to a table with existing
  generated columns with `ALTER TABLE`. It caused the `generated columns` to
  become non-generated such that it could no longer generate the values.
