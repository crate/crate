.. _version_3.0.1:

=============
Version 3.0.1
=============

Released on 2018/05/30.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.0.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 2.3 release before moving to
    3.0.1.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_3.0.0`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

    When restarting, CrateDB will migrate indexes to a newer format. Depending
    on the amount of data, this may delay node start-up time.

    Please consult the :ref:`version_3.0.0_upgrade_notes` before upgrading.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.0 and must be recreated before moving to 3.0.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog

Fixes
-----

  Admin-UI to be false.

- Fixed the default log file name to ``crate.log`` if no cluster name was
  explicitly specified in the settings.

  querying the ``sys.health`` table on a cluster that has ``blob`` tables.

- Fixed support for views with aliased literals in select list / groupBy /
  orderBy.

- Fixed a bug affecting the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol's Simple Query mode and
  queries which contained strings with escaped single quotes and semicolons,

- Fixed an issue in the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol's Simple Query mode which
  would send an empty statement if the query string contained trailing
  whitespace.
