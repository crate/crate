    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 4.0 release before moving to

4.1 series.


Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that prevented CrateDB from detecting changes to the SSL
  ``keystore`` or ``truststore`` if one the paths is a symlink.

- Fixed an issue that could prevent updating settings that depend on other
  settings. For example ``"cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low"``

- Fixed an issue that caused the ``ANALYZE`` statement to fail if there are
  tables with object arrays in the cluster.

- Fixed a performance issue that can lead to queries like ``SELECT text_column
  FROM tbl GROUP BY 1`` to run more than 150% faster.
