.. _version_3.1.2:

=============
Version 3.1.2
=============

Released on 2018/10/18.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 2.0.4 or higher
    before you upgrade to 3.1.2.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 3.0 release before moving to
    3.1.2.

    If you want to perform a `rolling upgrade`_, your current CrateDB version
    number must be at least :ref:`version_3.1.1`. Any upgrade from a version
    prior to this will require a `full restart upgrade`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created prior to upgrading to CrateDB 2.x will not
    function with 3.1 and must be recreated before moving to 3.1.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` while running a
    2.x release into a new table, or by `inserting the data into a new table`_.

    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

Changelog
=========


Fixes
-----

- Store current ``created`` versions at new table partitions instead of using
  potentially older versions stored at the partition table.

- Fixed an issue which caused tables created on versions < 3.0 using no longer
  supported table parameters to fail on ``ALTER TABLE`` statements.

- ``CORS`` pre-flight requests now no longer require authentication.

- Fixed an issue which caused joins over multiple relations and implicit join
  conditions inside the ``WHERE`` clause to fail.

- The ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` header is now correctly served by
  resources in the ``/_blobs`` endpoint if the relevant settings are enabled.

- Fixed decoding of PostgreSQL specific array literal constants where unquoted
  elements and single element arrays were not decoded correctly and resulted in
  an empty array.
