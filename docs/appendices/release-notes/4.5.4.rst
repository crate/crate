4.5 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a regression that caused the ``job_id`` column within the
  ``sys.operations_log`` table to return the ``id`` values instead of the
  ``job_id`` values.

- Fixed an issue that could result in a ``IOException: can not write type ...``
  error when combining values of type ``TIMETZ``, ``NUMERIC``, ``GEO_POINT`` or
  ``INTERVAL`` with values of type ``UNDEFINED``.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``INSERT FROM VALUE`` statements to insert
  records, despite failing validation and returning an error to the client.

- Fixed an issue that caused the ``NOW()`` and ``CURRENT_USER`` functions to
  get normalized to a literal value when used as part of a generated column or
  ``DEFAULT`` expression in a ``CREATE TABLE`` statement.

- Fixed a HBA SSL configuration parsing issue. The ``on`` value for the ``ssl``
  configuration option was not recognized and got interpreted as 'true'.
