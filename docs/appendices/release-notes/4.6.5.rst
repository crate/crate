4.6 series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused ``UNION ALL`` statements to succeed or throw
  unexpected exceptions when the ``SELECT`` results for ``UNION ALL`` included
  object types with identically named but differently typed sub-columns.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``date_format()`` to return wrong values when used
  with the ``%D`` specifier (day of month as ordinal number) for 11th, 12th and
  13th.

- Fixed a performance regression introduced in 4.2 which caused queries with
  ``WHERE`` clause on aliased column on top of views or virtual tables to be
  slow.

- Fixed an issue in ``HBA`` which caused entries with method ``cert`` for one
  protocol affect entries of other protocols in the way that client certificate
  is requested for ``trust`` or ``password`` entries of other protocols.

- Fixed an issue that threw an unexpected exception while converting a WKT
  string representing a valid polygon to ``geo_shape``.
