Version 5.10.16
===============

Released on 2025-12-10.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.10.16.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.9 release before moving to
    5.10.16.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.9.x to 5.10.16 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed a hash collision issue resulting in some unmatched rows not being
  returned when using a ``LEFT JOIN`` query with an equal join condition.
  Example::

    SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
