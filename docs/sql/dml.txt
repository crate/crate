Data Manipulation

Inserting Data
==============

Inserting data to ``Crate`` is done by using the SQL ``INSERT`` statement.

.. note::

    The column list at ``Crate`` is always ordered alphabetically by column name
    and so must the inserted column values.

Inserting a row::

    cr> insert into locations (id, date, description, kind, name, position)
    ... values (
    ...   '14',
    ...   '2013-09-12T21:43:59.000Z',
    ...   'Blagulon Kappa is the planet to which the police are native.',
    ...   'Planet',
    ...   'Blagulon Kappa',
    ...   7
    ... );
    INSERT OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

Inserting multiple rows at once (aka. bulk insert) can be done by defining
multiple values for the ``INSERT`` statement::

    cr> insert into locations (id, date, description, kind, name, position) values
    ... (
    ...   '16',
    ...   '2013-09-14T21:43:59.000Z',
    ...   'Blagulon Kappa II is the planet to which the police are native.',
    ...   'Planet',
    ...   'Blagulon Kappa II',
    ...   19
    ... ),
    ... (
    ...   '17',
    ...   '2013-09-13T16:43:59.000Z',
    ...   'Brontitall is a planet with a warm, rich atmosphere and no mountains.',
    ...   'Planet',
    ...   'Brontitall',
    ...   10
    ... );
    INSERT OK, 2 rows affected (... sec)

Inserting Data By Query
-----------------------

.. Hidden: refresh locations

    cr> refresh table locations
    REFRESH OK (... sec)

It is possible to insert data using a query instead of values. Column
data types of source and target table can differ as long as the values
are castable. This gives the opportunity to restructure the tables
data, renaming a field, changing a field's data type or convert a
normal table into a partitioned one.

Example of changing a field's data type, in this case, changing the
``position`` data type from integer to short::

    cr> create table locations2 (
    ...     id string primary key,
    ...     name string,
    ...     date timestamp,
    ...     kind string,
    ...     position short,
    ...     description string
    ... ) clustered by (id) into 2 shards with (number_of_replicas = 0);
    CREATE OK (... sec)

::

    cr> insert into locations2 (id, name, date, kind, postition, description)
    ... (
    ...     select id, name, date, kind, position, description
    ...     from locations
    ...     where position < 10
    ... );
    INSERT OK, 14 rows affected (... sec)

.. Hidden: drop previously created table

   cr> drop table locations2
    DROP OK (... sec)

Example of creating a new partitioned table out of the ``locations``
table with data partitioned by year::

    cr> create table locations_parted (
    ...     id string primary key,
    ...     name string,
    ...     year string primary key,
    ...     date timestamp,
    ...     kind string,
    ...     position integer
    ... ) clustered by (id) into 2 shards
    ... partitioned by (year) with (number_of_replicas = 0);
    CREATE OK (... sec)

::

    cr> insert into locations_parted (id, name, year, date, kind, postition)
    ... (
    ...     select
    ...         id,
    ...         name,
    ...         format('%tY', date_trunc('year', date)),
    ...         date,
    ...         kind,
    ...         position
    ...     from locations
    ... );
    INSERT OK, 16 rows affected (... sec)

Resulting partitions of the last insert by query::

    cr> select * from information_schema.table_partitions
    ... where table_name = 'locations_parted'
    ... order by partition_ident;
    +------------------+-------------+-----------------+------------------+
    | table_name       | schema_name | partition_ident | values           |
    +------------------+-------------+-----------------+------------------+
    | locations_parted | doc         | 042j2e9n74      | {"year": "1979"} |
    | locations_parted | doc         | 042j4c1h6c      | {"year": "2013"} |
    +------------------+-------------+-----------------+------------------+
    SELECT 2 rows in set (... sec)

.. Hidden: drop previously created table

   cr> drop table locations_parted;
    DROP OK (... sec)

.. note::

   ``limit``, ``offset`` and ``order by`` are not supported inside the
   query statement.


Updating Data
=============

In order to update documents in `Crate` the SQL `UPDATE` statement can be
used::

    cr> update locations set description = 'Updated description'
    ... where name = 'Bartledan';
    UPDATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

Updating nested objects is also supported::

    cr> update locations set race['name'] = 'Human' where name = 'Bartledan';
    UPDATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

It's also possible to reference a column within the expression, for example to
increment a number like this::

    cr> update locations set position = position + 1 where position < 3;
    UPDATE OK, 6 rows affected (... sec)

.. note::

    If the same documents are updated concurrently an VersionConflictException
    might occur. Crate contains a retry logic that tries to resolve the
    conflict automatically. But if it fails more than 3 times the document
    doesn't get updated and a zero row count is returned.

Deleting Data
=============

Deleting rows in Crate is done using the SQL ``DELETE`` statement::

    cr> delete from locations where position > 3;
    DELETE OK, ... rows affected (... sec)


.. _importing_data:

Import/Export
=============

Importing Data
--------------

Using the ``COPY FROM`` SQL statement, data can be imported into Crate.
Currently the only supported data format is JSON, one line is representing one entry.

.. highlight:: json

Example JSON data::

    {"id": 1, "quote": "Don't panic"}
    {"id": 2, "quote": "Ford, you're turning into a penguin. Stop it."}

.. note::

  Existing entries will be overwritten on import.

.. note::

  The ``COPY FROM`` statement will not convert or validate your data.
  Please make sure that it fits your schema.

In order to import data into :ref:`sql_ddl_partitioned_by` take a look at the
:ref:`copy_from` reference.

Import From File URI
....................

.. highlight:: psql

An example import from a file URI::

    cr> copy quotes from 'file:///tmp/import_data/quotes.json';
    COPY OK, 3 rows affected (... sec)

If all files inside a directory should be imported a ``*`` wildcard has to be
used::

    cr> copy quotes from '/tmp/import_data/*' with (concurrency = 1, bulk_size = 4);
    COPY OK, 3 rows affected (... sec)

This wildcard can also be used to only match certain files::

    cr> copy quotes from '/tmp/import_data/qu*.json';
    COPY OK, 3 rows affected (... sec)

See :ref:`copy_from` for more information.

.. _exporting_data:

Exporting Data
--------------

Data can be exported using the ``COPY TO`` statement. Data is exported in a
distributed way, meaning each node will export its own data.

Replicated data is not exported. So every row of an exported table is
stored only once.

.. note::

 Data is written per shard. To prevent corrupted exports when more than one
 shard is allocated on a node, or data is exported to a shared storage system,
 use the ``DIRECTORY`` keyword (see :ref:`copy_to`).

This example shows how to export a given table into files named after
the table and shard id with gzip compression::

    cr> refresh table quotes;
    REFRESH OK...

::

    cr> copy quotes to DIRECTORY '/tmp/' with (compression='gzip');
    COPY OK, 3 rows affected ...

For further details see :ref:`copy_to`.
