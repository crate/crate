Data Definition in Crate
========================


Table Basics
============

To create a table use the ``CREATE TABLE`` command. You must at least specify a name for the
table and names and types of the columns.
See `Data Types` for information about the supported data types.

Let's create a simple table with two columns of type ``integer`` and ``string``::

    cr> create table my_table (
    ...   first_column integer,
    ...   second_column string
    ... )

A table can be removed by using the ``DROP TABLE`` command::

    cr> drop table my_table

Constraints
===========

Primary Key
-----------

The primary key constraint combines a unique constraint and a not-null constraint. It also defines
the default routing value used for sharding. Example::

    cr> create table my_table1 (
    ...   first_column integer primary key,
    ...   second_column string
    ... )

Currently primary key's cannot be auto generated and have to be specified if
data is inserted, otherwise an error is returned.

.. note::

  Multiple primary keys are not supported yet.


Indexes and Fulltext Search
===========================

Indexes for fulltextsearch are created using an analyzer that consists of
one tokenizer and zero or more token filters and char filters.
Existing Analyzers can be used to create custom Analyzers by means of extending them.


Create Analyzer Syntax::

    CREATE ANALYZER <analyzer_name> [EXTENDS <analyzer_name>] (
        [TOKENIZER [WITH] (
            <tokenizer_property>=<value>,
            ...
        )]
        [TOKEN_FILTERS [WITH] (
            <builtin_token_filter_name> [WITH] (
                <token_filter_property>=<value>,
                ...
            ),
            ...
        )]
        [CHAR_FILTERS [WITH] (
            <builtin_char_filter_name> [WITH] (
                <char_filter_property>=<value>,
                ...
            ),
            ...
        )]
    )

Built-in and self-made Analyzers can be used to create iundices by referencing them by name.

Create a Fulltext Index::

    CREATE INDEX <index_name> ON <table_name> USING <method>(<column_name>, ...)
    [
        WITH (
            <index_property>=<value>
        )
    ]

Where possible ``index_property`` values are::

    analyzer=<analyzer_name>

And possible ``methods`` are::

    fulltext

This is the only index-method currently supported. It uses the given analyzer to create a fulltext-searchable
representation of the fields it is defined for.

Defining Indexes on Columns within ``CREATE TABLE``-Statements.
This way only a single column can be indexed, no combination of columns as with the ``CREATE INDEX`` statement::

    CREATE TABLE t1 (
        field string INDEX [ USING <method> [WITH] (<index_property>=<value>) | OFF ]
    )




Data Types
==========

string
------

A text-based basic type containing one or more character. Example::

    cr> create table my_table2 (
    ...   first_column string,
    ... )


number
------

Crate supports a set of number types: ``integer``,``long``, ``short``, ``double``,
``float`` and ``byte``. All types have the same ranges as corresponding `Java types`_.
Example::

    cr> create table my_table3 (
    ...   first_column integer,
    ...   second_column long,
    ...   third_column short,
    ...   fourth_column double,
    ...   fifth_column float,
    ...   sixth_column byte
    ... )

timestamp
---------

The timestamp type is a special type which maps to a formatted string. Internally it maps to
a ``long``, adding the parsing from long to string and vice versa. All timestamps a treat as UTC.
The default format is dateOptionalTime_ and cannot be changed currently. It will also accept a
``long`` representing UTC milliseconds since the epoch. Example::

    cr> create table my_table4 (
    ...   first_column timestamp
    ... )


Sharding
========

Number of shards
----------------

Crate supports sharding natively, it even uses *5* shards by default if not further defined.
The number of shards can be defined by using the ``CLUSTERED INTO <number> SHARDS`` statement on
table creation. Example::

    cr> create table my_table5 (
    ...   first_column int
    ... ) clustered into 10 shards

.. note::

  The number of shards can only be set on table creation, it cannot be changed later on.

Routing
-------

The column used for routing can be freely defined using the ``CLUSTERED BY (<column>)``
statement and is used to route a row to a particular shard. Example::

    cr> create table my_table6 (
    ...   first_column int,
    ...   second_column string
    ... ) clustered by (second_column)


By default Crate is using the primary keys for routing the request to the involved shards. So
following two examples resulting in the same behaviour::

    cr> create table my_table7 (
    ...   first_column int primary key,
    ...   second_column string
    ... )

    cr> create table my_table8 (
    ...   first_column int,
    ...   second_column string
    ... ) clustered by (first_column)

If no primary is defined an internal generated unique id is used for routing.

Example for combining custom routing and shard definition::

    cr> create table my_table9 (
    ...   first_column int,
    ...   second_column string
    ... ) clustered by (first_column) into 10 shards


Replication
===========

By default Crate uses an replication factor of 1. If e.g. a cluster with 2 nodes is set up and
an index is created using 5 shards, each node will have 5 shards.
Defining the number of replicas is done using the ``REPLICAS <number_of_replicas>`` statement.
Example::

    cr> create table my_table10 (
    ...   first_column int,
    ...   second_column string
    ... ) replicas 1

.. note::

  The number of replicas can be changed at any time.
