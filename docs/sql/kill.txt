Kill Jobs
=========

Each executed sql statement results in a corresponding job.
Jobs that are currently executed are logged in the system table ``sys.jobs`` 
(see :ref:`jobs_operations_logs`).

To obtain the `UUID`_ of a job you need to enable stats 
(see :ref:`conf_collecting_stats`). The job logging can be prevented by 
setting the queue size to zero.

Killing an active job forces Crate to stop its execution on the cluster 
immediately. There are two different SQL commands available for killing jobs.

The ``KILL ALL`` statement stops every single job on each node that is 
currently running. It returns the total number of contexts of all jobs of that 
have been killed. A job can have contexts on multiple nodes.

::

    cr> kill all;
    KILL OK, ... rows affected (... sec)

``KILL job_id`` only kills one single job with the specified ``job_id``. Like 
``KILL ALL`` it returns the total number of contexts of that job killed on all 
nodes. As same as ``KILL ALL`` it returns the number of jobs that have been 
killed stopped per node.

::

    cr> kill '175011ce-9bbc-45f2-a86a-5b7f993a93a6';
    KILL OK, ... rows affected (... sec)

See :ref:`sql_kill` for detail syntax information on the ``KILL`` statements.
