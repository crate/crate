Kill Jobs
=========

Each executed sql statement results in a corresponding job.
Jobs that are currently executed are listed in the ``sys.jobs`` system table
(see :ref:`jobs_operations_logs`).

To obtain the `UUID`_ of a job you need to enable stats
(see :ref:`conf_collecting_stats`). The job logging can be prevented by
setting the queue size to zero.

Killing an active job forces Crate to stop its execution on the cluster
immediately. There are two different SQL commands available for killing jobs.

The ``KILL ALL`` statement stops on each node every single job that is currently
running. It returns the total number of contexts of all jobs of that have been
killed (see :ref:`sql_kill`).

::

    cr> kill all;
    KILL OK, ... rows affected (... sec)

Like ``KILL ALL`` the ``KILL job_id`` statement only kills one single job with
the specified ``job_id``. As same as ``KILL ALL`` it returns the number of
distinct jobs that have been killed on each node in the cluster.

::

    cr> kill '175011ce-9bbc-45f2-a86a-5b7f993a93a6';
    KILL OK, ... rows affected (... sec)

See :ref:`sql_kill` for detailed syntax information on the ``KILL`` statements.
