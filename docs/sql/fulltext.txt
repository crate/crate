Fulltext Search
===============

In order to use fulltext searches on columns, one must create a
:ref:`fulltext index with an analyzer <sql_ddl_index_fulltext>` on the related column
upfront on table creation, see :ref:`fulltext-indices` for details.


.. _predicates_match:

MATCH Predicate
===============

Synopsis
--------

::

    MATCH (
         {  column_ident | ( column_ident [boost]  [, ...] ) }
     , query_term
    )  [ using match_type [ with ( match_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ] ]


The MATCH predicate performs a fulltext search on one or multiple indexed columns or indices
and supports different matching techniques. It can also be used to perform :ref:`geographical
searches <sql_dql_geo_search>` on :ref:`geo_shape_data_type` indices.

The actual usage of the predicate depends on the type of the queried index.
More exactly the available ``match_type`` and ``match_parameters``
depend on the index type used. This section only covers the usage of the
MATCH predicate on ``fulltext`` indices on string columns.
For usage on :ref:`geo_shape_data_type` indices, see :ref:`sql_dql_geo_search`.

Furthermore it is not possible to query
multiple index columns with different index types with one match predicate.

In order to use fulltext searches on a column, a :ref:`fulltext index with an analyzer <sql_ddl_index_fulltext>`
must be created on the related column. See :ref:`fulltext-indices` for details.

To get the relevance of a matching row, an internal system column
:ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` can be selected.
It is a numeric value which is not absolute but relative to the other rows.
The higher the score value, the more relevant the row::

    cr> select name, _score from locations where match(name_description_ft, 'time') order by _score desc;
    +-----------+------------+
    | name      |     _score |
    +-----------+------------+
    | Bartledan | 0.52200186 |
    | Altair    | 0.4790727  |
    +-----------+------------+
    SELECT 2 rows in set (... sec)

The MATCH predicate in its simplest form performs a fulltext search against a single column.
It takes the ``query_term`` and analyzes it with the same analyzer configured on ``column_ident``
if no ``analyzer`` is given in the match parameters.
The resulting tokens are matched against the already indexed tokens at ``column_ident``.
If any of the ``query_term`` tokens is contained in the ``column_ident`` tokens,
MATCH returns ``TRUE``.

The MATCH predicate can be also used to perform a fulltext search on multiple
columns with a single ``query_term``. Using this variant, it is possible to manipulate the relevance of a
column by referencing it using its ``column_ident`` and the ``boost`` argument.
Matches on columns with a higher boost result in a higher :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` value
for that document.

How the single ``query_term`` is applied to the variable number of columns
and how the resulting :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` is computed
is determined by the ``match_type`` argument. See :ref:`predicates_match_types`.

Without explicit ordering using ``ORDER BY`` the results are sorted by relevance.

Arguments
.........

:column_ident: A reference to an index column or an existing column that is of type ``string`` and is indexed.
               By default every column is indexed but only the raw data is stored.
               So matching against a ``string`` column without a fulltext index is equivalent to using the ``=`` operator.
               To perform real fulltext searches using a :ref:`sql_ddl_index_fulltext` is mandatory.

:boost: a column ident can have a boost attached. That is a factor that increases
        the relevance of a column in respect to the other columns. The default boost
        is 1.

:query_term: This string is analyzed (using the explicitly given ``analyzer``
             or the analyzer of the columns to perform the search on)
             and the resulting tokens are compared to the already indexed ones.
             The tokens used for search are combined using the ``OR`` operator
             if not stated otherwise using the ``operator`` option, so only
             one of the resulting tokens has to match to include a row.

:match_type: Optional. Defaults to ``best_fields`` for fulltext indices. For details see :ref:`predicates_match_types`.


.. _predicates_match_types:

Match Types
...........

The match type determines how the ``query_term`` is applied and the :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>`
is created, thus it influences which documents are considered more relevant.
The default ``match_type`` for fulltext indices is ``best_fields``.

:best_fields: Use the :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` of the column that matched best.
              For example if a column contains all the tokens of the ``query_term``
              it is considered more relevant than another column only containing one of them.

              This type is the default, if omitted.

:most_fields: This match type takes the :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` of every matching column
              and combines their scores to one by calculating a simple mean.

:cross_fields: This match type analyzes the ``query_term`` into tokens and searches all the tokens
               of all given columns at once as if they were one big column (given they have the same analyzer).
               All tokens have to be present in at least one column.
               So querying for ``foo bar`` should have the tokens ``foo`` in one column and ``bar`` in the same or any other.

:phrase: This match type differs from ``best_fields`` in that it constructs a phrase query from the ``query_term``.
         A phrase query will only match if the tokens in the columns are in the same order than the
         analyzed columns from the ``query_term``.
         So, querying for ``foo bar`` (analyzed tokens: ``foo`` and ``bar``) will only match
         if one of the columns contains those two token in order.

:phrase_prefix: This match type is roughly the same than ``phrase`` but it allows to match by prefix
                on the last token of the ``query_term``. For example if your query for ``foo ba``,
                one of the columns has to contain ``foo`` and a token that starts with ``ba`` in that order.
                So a column containing ``foo baz`` would match and ``foo bar`` too.


Options
~~~~~~~

The match options further distinguish the way the matching process using a certain match type works.
Not all options are applicable to all match types. See the options below for details.

:analyzer: The analyzer used to convert the ``query_term`` into tokens.

:boost: This numeric value is multiplied with the resulting :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` of
        this ``match`` call. If this ``match`` call is used with other conditions in the where clause
        a value above ``1.0`` will increase its influence on the overall :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>`
        of the whole query, a value below ``1.0`` will decrease it.

:cutoff_frequency: The token frequency is the number of occurences of a token in a column.
                   This option specifies a minimum token frequency that excludes
                   matching tokens with a higher frequency from the overall :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>`.
                   Their :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` is only included
                   if another token with a lower frequency also matches.
                   This can be used to suppress results where only high frequency terms like ``the`` would cause a match.

:fuzziness: Can be used to perform fuzzy full text search.
            On numeric columns use a numeric, on timestamp columns a long indicating milliseconds,
            on strings use a number indicating the maximum allowed Levenshtein Edit Distance.
            Use ``prefix_length``, ``fuzzy_rewrite`` and ``max_expansions`` to fine tune the fuzzy matching process.

:fuzzy_rewrite: The same than ``rewrite`` but only applies to queries using ``fuzziness``.


:max_expansions: When using ``fuzziness`` or ``phrase_prefix`` this options controls
                 to how many different possible tokens a search token will be expanded.
                 The ``fuzziness`` controls how big the distance or difference
                 between the original token and the set of tokens it is expanded to can be.
                 This option controls how big this set can get.

:minimum_should_match: The number of tokens from the ``query_term`` to match when ``or`` is used.
                       Defaults to ``1``.

:operator: Can be ``or`` or ``and``. The default is ``or``. It is used to combine the tokens of the ``query_term``.
           If ``and`` is used, every token from the ``query_term`` has to match. If ``or`` is used only the number of
           ``minimum_should_match`` have to match.

:prefix_length: When used with ``fuzziness`` option or with ``phrase_prefix``
                this options controls how long the common prefix of the tokens
                that are considered as similar (same prefix or fuzziness distance/difference)has to be.

:rewrite: When using ``phrase_prefix`` the prefix query is constructed
          using all possible terms and rewriting them into another kind of query to compute the score.
          Possible values are ``constant_score_auto``, ``constant_score_boolean``, ``constant_score_filter``,
          ``scoring_boolean``,``top_terms_N``, ``top_terms_boost_N``. The ``constant_...`` values
          can be used together with the ``boost`` option to set a constant :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>`
          for rows with a matching prefix or fuzzy match.

:slop: When matching for phrases this option controls how exact the phrase match should be.
       If set to ``0`` (the default), the terms must be in the exact order.
       If two transposed terms should match, a minimum ``slop`` of ``2`` has to be set.
       Only applicable to ``phrase`` and ``phrase_prefix`` queries.


:tie_breaker: When using ``best_fields``, ``phrase`` or ``phrase_prefix``
              the :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` of every other column
              will be multiplied with this value and added to the
              :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` of the best matching column.
              Defaults to ``0.0``. Not applicable to match type ``most_fields``
              as this type is executed as if it had a ``tie_breaker`` of ``1.0``.


:zero_terms_query: If no tokens are generated analyzing the ``query_term`` then no documents are matched.
                   If ``all`` is given here, all documents are matched.



Usage
=====

A fulltext search is done using the :ref:`predicates_match` predicate::

    cr> select name from locations where match(name_description_ft, 'time') order by _score desc;
    +-----------+
    | name      |
    +-----------+
    | Bartledan |
    | Altair    |
    +-----------+
    SELECT 2 rows in set (... sec)

It returns ``TRUE`` for rows which match the search string. To get more detailed
information about the quality of a match, the relevance of the row,
the :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` can be selected::

    cr> select name, _score
    ... from locations where match(name_description_ft, 'time') order by _score desc;
    +-----------+------------+
    | name      |     _score |
    +-----------+------------+
    | Bartledan | 0.52200186 |
    | Altair    | 0.4790727  |
    +-----------+------------+
    SELECT 2 rows in set (... sec)

.. note::

    The `_score` is a relative and not an absolute value. It just sets
    a row in relation to the other ones.

.. note::

   By default, results are not ordered. Ordering by `_score` must be
   defined explicitly if needed.


Searching On Multiple Columns
=============================

There are two possibilities if a search should span the contents of multiple columns:

* use a composite index column on your table. See :ref:`sql-ddl-composite-index`.

* use the :ref:`predicates_match` predicate on multiple columns.

When querying multiple columns, there are many ways how the resulting match relevance a.k.a.
:ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` can be computed, that means which documents match and
in which order. These different techniques are called :ref:`predicates_match_types`.

To increase the relevance of rows where one columns matches extremely
well, use ``best_fields`` (the default).
If rows with good matches spread over all searched columns should be more relevant,
use ``most_fields`` . If searching multiple columns as if they were one,
use the ``cross_fields`` type.
For searching of matching phrases (tokens are in the same order)
use ``phrase`` or ``phrase_prefix``::

    cr> select name, _score from locations
    ... where match(
    ...     (name_description_ft, race['name'] 1.5, kind 0.75),
    ...     'end of the galaxy'
    ... ) order by _score desc;
    +-------------------+------------+
    | name              |     _score |
    +-------------------+------------+
    | NULL              | 0.91878563 |
    | Altair            | 0.11727207 |
    | Aldebaran         | 0.10617954 |
    | North West Ripple | 0.06788038 |
    | Outer Eastern Rim | 0.06788038 |
    +-------------------+------------+
    SELECT 5 rows in set (... sec)

::

    cr> select name, description, _score from locations
    ... where match(
    ...     (name_description_ft), 'end of the galaxy'
    ... ) using phrase with (analyzer='english', slop=4);
    +------+-------------------------+----------+
    | name | description             |   _score |
    +------+-------------------------+----------+
    | NULL | The end of the Galaxy.% | 2.296235 |
    +------+-------------------------+----------+
    SELECT 1 row in set (... sec)

A vast amount of options exist to fine-tune your fulltext search.
A detailed reference can be found here :ref:`predicates_match`.


Negative Search
===============

A negative fulltext search can be done using a ``NOT`` clause::

    cr> select name, _score from locations
    ... where not match(name_description_ft, 'time')
    ... order by _score, name asc;
    +------------------------------------+--------+
    | name                               | _score |
    +------------------------------------+--------+
    |                                    |    1.0 |
    | Aldebaran                          |    1.0 |
    | Algol                              |    1.0 |
    | Allosimanius Syneca                |    1.0 |
    | Alpha Centauri                     |    1.0 |
    | Argabuthon                         |    1.0 |
    | Arkintoofle Minor                  |    1.0 |
    | Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma |    1.0 |
    | North West Ripple                  |    1.0 |
    | Outer Eastern Rim                  |    1.0 |
    | NULL                               |    1.0 |
    +------------------------------------+--------+
    SELECT 11 rows in set (... sec)


Filter By :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>`
=====================================================

It is possible to filter results by the :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` column
but as it's value is a ratio related to the highest score of all result and thus never
absolute and directly comparable across searches its use-case is very limited if any.
It is only possible to filter by the greater-than-or-equals('>=') operator on the
:ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` column.

Anyway let's do it here for demonstration purpose::

    cr> select name, _score
    ... from locations where match(name_description_ft, 'time')
    ... and _score >= 0.8;
    +-----------+------------+
    | name      |     _score |
    +-----------+------------+
    | Altair    | 0.88735807 |
    | Bartledan | 0.8679331  |
    +-----------+------------+
    SELECT 2 rows in set (... sec)

As you maybe noticed, the :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` value has changed for the
same query text and document because it's a ratio related to all results,
and if we limit it by filtering on :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>`,
we'll have fewer or different results.

.. warning::

  As noted above :ref:`_score <sql_ddl_system_column_score>` is a ratio and not comparable
  across search so use it only for filtering if you know what you're doing and on your own risk.
