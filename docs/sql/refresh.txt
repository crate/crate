Refresh
=======

Crate is `eventually consistent`_. Data written with a former statement is
not guaranteed to be fetched with the next following select statement for
the affected rows.

If required a table can be refreshed explicitly in order to ensure
that the latest state of the table gets fetched::

    cr> refresh table locations;
    REFRESH OK, ...

A table is refreshed periodically with a specified refresh interval. By
default, the refresh interval is set to 1000 milliseconds. The refresh interval
of a table can be changed with the table parameter ``refresh_interval`` (see
:ref:`sql_ref_refresh_interval`).
