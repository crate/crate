Refresh
=======

Crate is `eventual consistent`_. Data written with a former statement is
not guaranteed to be fetched with the next following select statement for
the affected rows.

If required one or more tables can be refreshed explicitly in order
to ensure that the latest state of the table gets fetched.

::

    cr> refresh table locations;
    REFRESH OK (... sec)

A table is refreshed periodically with a specified refresh interval. By
default, the refresh interval is set to 1000 milliseconds. The refresh interval
of a table can be changed with the table parameter ``refresh_interval`` (see
:ref:`sql_ref_refresh_interval`).


Multiple Table Refresh
======================

.. Hidden: CREATE TABLE::

    cr> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS parted_table (
    ...   id long,
    ...   title string,
    ...   content string,
    ...   width double,
    ...   day timestamp
    ... ) CLUSTERED BY (title) INTO 4 SHARDS PARTITIONED BY (day);
    CREATE OK (... sec)

.. Hidden: INSERT INTO::

    cr> INSERT INTO parted_table (id, title, width, day)
    ... VALUES (1, 'Don''t Panic', 19.5, '2014-04-08');
    INSERT OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

If needed, multiple tables can be defined comma-separated in a single
SQL request. This ensures that they all get refreshed and so their datasets
get consistent. The result message is printed if the request on every given
table is completed.

::

    cr> REFRESH TABLE locations, parted_table;
    REFRESH OK (... sec)


.. note::

    If one or more tables or partitions do not exist, none of the given
    tables/partitions are refreshed and an error is returned. The error returns
    only the first non-existent table/partition.


Partition Refresh
=================

Additionally it is possible to define a specific ``PARTITION`` of a partitioned
table which should be refreshed (see :ref:`partitioned_tables`).

By using the ``PARTITION`` clause in the refresh statement a seperate request for
a given partion can be performed. That means that only specific partitions of
a partitioned table are refreshed. For further details on how to create a refresh
request on partitioned tables see the SQL syntax and its synopsis (see :ref:`sql_ref_refresh`).

::

    cr> REFRESH TABLE parted_table PARTITION (day='2014-04-08');
    REFRESH OK (... sec)

In case the ``PARTITION`` clause is omitted all partitions will be refreshed. If a
table has many partiones this should be avoided due to performance reasons.
