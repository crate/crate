Refresh
=======

Crate is `eventually consistent`_. Data written with a former statement is
not guaranteed to be fetched with the next following select statement for
the affected rows.

If required a table or multiple tables can be refreshed explicitly in order 
to ensure that the latest state of the table gets fetched.

.. hide:

    cr> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS parted_table (
    ...   id long,
    ...   title string,
    ...   content string,
    ...   width double,
    ...   day timestamp
    ... ) CLUSTERED BY (title) INTO 4 SHARDS PARTITIONED BY (day);
    CREATE OK (... sec)

.. hide:

    cr> INSERT INTO parted_table (id, title, width, day)
    ... VALUES (1, 'Don''t Panic', 19.5, '2014-04-08');
    INSERT OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

In case the ``PARTITION`` clause is omitted all partitions will be refreshed. ::
    
    cr> REFRESH TABLE locations, parted_table;
    REFRESH OK (... sec)


In case of using the ``PARTITION`` clause only specific partitions of a partitioned 
table are refreshed. ::

    cr> REFRESH TABLE locations, 
    ... parted_table PARTITION (day='2014-04-08');
    REFRESH OK (... sec)

A table is refreshed periodically with a specified refresh interval. By
default, the refresh interval is set to 1000 milliseconds. The refresh interval
of a table can be changed with the table parameter ``refresh_interval`` (see
:ref:`sql_ref_refresh_interval`).

  DROP OK (... sec)
