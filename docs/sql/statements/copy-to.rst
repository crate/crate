Synopsis
========

::

    COPY table_ident [ PARTITION ( partition_column = value [ , ... ] ) ]
                     [ ( column [ , ...] ) ]
                     [ WHERE condition ]

.. _sql-copy-to-desc:

Description
===========

The ``COPY TO`` command exports the contents of a table to one or more files
into a given directory with unique filenames. Each node with at least one shard
of the table will export its contents onto their local disk.

The created files are JSON formatted and contain one table row per line and,
due to the distributed nature of CrateDB, *will remain on the same nodes*
*where the shards are*.

Here's an example:

::

    cr> COPY quotes TO DIRECTORY '/tmp/' with (compression='gzip');
    COPY OK, 3 rows affected ...

.. NOTE::

   Currently only user tables can be exported. System tables like ``sys.nodes``
   and blob tables don't work with the ``COPY TO`` statement.


.. _sql-copy-to-params:

Parameters
==========

.. _sql-copy-to-table_ident:

``table_ident``
  The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to be exported.

.. _sql-copy-to-column:

``column``
  (optional) A list of column :ref:`expressions <gloss-expression>` that should
  be exported.

  .. NOTE::

      When declaring columns, this changes the output to JSON list format,
      which is currently not supported by the ``COPY FROM`` statement.


.. _sql-copy-to-clauses:

Clauses
=======


.. _sql-copy-to-partition:

``PARTITION``
-------------

.. EDITORIAL NOTE
   ##############

   Multiple files (in this directory) use the same standard text for
   documenting the ``PARTITION`` clause. (Minor verb changes are made to
   accomodate the specifics of the parent statement.)

   For consistency, if you make changes here, please be sure to make a
   corresponding change to the other files.

If the table is :ref:`partitioned <partitioned-tables>`, the optional
``PARTITION`` clause can be used to export data from a one partition
exclusively.

::

    [ PARTITION ( partition_column = value [ , ... ] ) ]

:partition_column:
  One of the column names used for table partitioning.

:value:
  The respective column value.

All :ref:`partition columns <gloss-partition-column>` (specified by the
:ref:`sql-create-table-partitioned-by` clause) must be listed inside the
parentheses along with their respective values using the ``partition_column =
value`` syntax (separated by commas).

Because each partition corresponds to a unique set of :ref:`partition column
<gloss-partition-column>` row values, this clause uniquely identifies a single
partition to export.

.. TIP::

    The :ref:`ref-show-create-table` statement will show you the complete list
    of partition columns specified by the
    :ref:`sql-create-table-partitioned-by` clause.

.. CAUTION::

    The exported data doesn't contain the partition columns or the
    corresponding values because they are not part of the partitioned tables.

    If ``COPY TO`` is used on a partitioned table without the ``PARTITION``
    clause, the partition columns and values will be included in the rows of
    the exported files. If a partition column is a generated column, it will
    not be included even if the ``PARTITION`` clause is missing.


.. _sql-copy-to-where:

``WHERE``
---------

The ``WHERE`` clauses use the same syntax as ``SELECT`` statements, allowing
partial exports. (see :ref:`sql_dql_where_clause` for more information).


.. _sql-copy-to-to:

``TO``
------

The ``TO`` clause allows you to specify an output location.

::

    TO DIRECTORY output_uri


.. _sql-copy-to-to-params:

Parameters
''''''''''

``output_uri``
  An :ref:`expression <gloss-expression>` must :ref:`evaluate
  <gloss-evaluation>` to a string literal that is a `well-formed URI`_. URIs
  must use one of the supported :ref:`URI schemes <sql-copy-from-schemes>`.

  .. NOTE::

      If the URI scheme is missing, CrateDB assumes the value is a pathname and
      will prepend the :ref:`file <sql-copy-from-file>` URI scheme (i.e.,
      ``file://``). So, for example, CrateDB will convert ``/tmp/file.json`` to
      ``file:///tmp/file.json``.


.. _sql-copy-to-schemes:

URI schemes
-----------

CrateDB supports the following URI schemes:

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


.. _sql-copy-to-file:

``file``
''''''''

You can use the ``file://`` scheme to specify an absolute path to an output
location on the local file system.

For example:

.. code-block:: text

    file:///path/to/dir

.. TIP::

    If you are running CrateDB inside a container, the location must be inside
    the container. If you are using *Docker*, you may have to configure a
    `Docker volume`_ to accomplish this.

.. TIP::

    If you are using *Microsoft Windows*, you must include the drive letter in
    the file URI.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: text

        file://C:\/tmp/import_data/quotes.json

    Consult the `Windows documentation`_ for more information.


.. _sql-copy-to-s3:

``s3``
''''''

You can use the ``s3://`` scheme to access buckets on the `Amazon Simple
Storage Service`_ (Amazon S3).

For example:

.. code-block:: text

    s3://[<accesskey>:<secretkey>@][<host>:<port>/]<bucketname>/<path>

S3 compatible storage providers can be specified by the optional pair of host
and port, which defaults to Amazon S3 if not provided.

Here is a more concrete example:

.. code-block:: text

    COPY t TO DIRECTORY 's3://myAccessKey:mySecretKey@s3.amazonaws.com:80/myBucket/key1' with (protocol = 'http')

If no credentials are set the s3 client will operate in anonymous mode.
See `AWS Java Documentation`_.

.. TIP::

   A ``secretkey`` provided by Amazon Web Services can contain characters such
   as '/', '+' or '='. These characters must be `URL encoded`_. For a detailed
   explanation read the official `AWS documentation`_.

   To escape a secret key, you can use a snippet like this:

   .. code-block:: console

      sh$ python -c "from getpass import getpass; from urllib.parse import quote_plus; print(quote_plus(getpass('secret_key: ')))"

   This will prompt for the secret key and print the encoded variant.

   Additionally, versions prior to 0.51.x use HTTP for connections to S3. Since
   0.51.x these connections are using the HTTPS protocol. Please make sure you
   update your firewall rules to allow outgoing connections on port ``443``.


.. _sql-copy-to-with:

``WITH``
--------

You can use the optional ``WITH`` clause to specify copy parameter values.

::

    [ WITH ( copy_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]


The ``WITH`` clause supports the following copy parameters:

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


.. _sql-copy-to-compression:

``compression``
'''''''''''''''

Define if and how the exported data should be compressed.

By default the output is not compressed.

Possible values for the ``compression`` setting are:

``gzip``
  Use gzip_ to compress the data output.


.. _sql-copy-to-protocol:

``protocol``
'''''''''''''''

Used for :ref:`s3 <sql-copy-to-s3>` scheme only. It is set to HTTPS by
default.


.. _sql-copy-to-format:

``format``
''''''''''

Optional parameter to override default output behavior.

Possible values for the ``format`` settings are:

``json_object``
  Each row in the result set is serialized as JSON object and written to an
  output file where one line contains one object. This is the default behavior
  if no columns are defined. Use this format to import with
  :ref:`COPY FROM <sql-copy-from>`.

``json_array``
  Each row in the result set is serialized as JSON array, storing one array per
  line in an output file. This is the default behavior if columns are defined.


.. _sql-copy-to-wait_for_completion:

``wait_for_completion``
'''''''''''''''''''''''

A boolean value indicating if the ``COPY TO`` should wait for
the copy operation to complete. If set to ``false`` the request
returns at once and the copy operation runs in the background.
Defaults to ``true``.
