Synopsis
========

::

    CREATE PUBLICATION name
    { FOR TABLE table_name [, ...] | FOR ALL TABLES }

.. _sql-create-publication-desc:

Description
===========

Add a new :ref:`publication <logical-replication-publication>` to the current
cluster. The publication name must be distinct from the name of any existing
publication in the current cluster. A publication represents a group of tables
whose data changes can be replicated by other clusters (subscribers) by
creating a :ref:`subscription <logical-replication-subscription>`.

If neither ``FOR TABLE`` nor ``FOR ALL TABLES`` is specified, then the publication
starts out with an empty set of tables. That is useful if tables are to be
added later. The creation of a publication does not start any replication.

.. _sql-create-publication-params:

Parameters
===========

**name**
  The name of the new publication.

**FOR TABLE**
  Specifies a list of tables to add to the publication. The partitions of a
  partitioned table are always implicitly considered part of the publication.

**FOR ALL TABLES**
  Marks the publication as one that replicates changes for all tables in the
  cluster, including tables created in the future.
