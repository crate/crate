   END [ WORK | TRANSACTION ]


Parameters
==========

`WORK`
`TRANSACTION`

Optional keywords. They have no effect.

Description
===========

The statement commits the current transaction.

As CrateDB does not support transactions, the only effect of this command is
to close all existing cursors ``WITHOUT HOLD`` in the current session.
