=====================
``CREATE REPOSITORY``
=====================

Register a new repository used to store, manage and restore snapshots.

.. rubric:: Table of contents

.. contents::
   :local:

Synopsis
========

::

    CREATE REPOSITORY repository_name TYPE type
    [ WITH (repository_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]

Description
===========

``CREATE REPOSITORY`` will register a new repository in the cluster.

.. NOTE::

   If the repository configuration points to a location with existing
   snapshots, these are made available to the cluster.

Repositories are declared using a ``repository_name``, ``type`` and set of
parameters.

Further configuration parameters are given in the WITH Clause.

.. rubric:: Parameters

:repository_name:
  The name of the repository as identifier

:type:
  The type of the repository, see :ref:`ref-create-repository-types`.

It is not possible to change parameters that were used to create a repository.
Any changes to repository parameters that would prevent it from functioning
would require removing the old and creating a new repository with the same
type, name, and adjusted parameters. Please use the :ref:`ref-drop-repository`
and :ref:`ref-create-repository` for this purpose. Note that the repository's
snapshots won't be affected by this change and can be accessed via the new
repository.

Clauses
=======

``WITH``
--------

::

    [ WITH (repository_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]

The following configuration parameters apply to repositories of all types.

For further configuration options see the documentation of the repository
``type`` (e.g. type :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-fs`).

:max_restore_bytes_per_sec:
  The maximum rate at which snapshots are restored on a single node from
  this repository.

  Default: ``40mb`` per second.

:max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec:
  The maximum rate at which snapshots are created on a single node to
  this repository.

  Default: ``40mb`` per second.

.. _ref-create-repository-types:

Types
=====

A type determines how and where a repository stores its snapshots.

The supported types are the following. More types are supported via `plugins`_.

.. _plugins: https://github.com/crate/crate/blob/master/devs/docs/plugins.rst

.. _ref-create-repository-types-fs:

``fs``
------

A repository storing its snapshots to a shared filesystem that must be
accessible by all master and data nodes in the cluster.

.. NOTE::

   To create repositories of this type, it's necessary to configure the
   possible locations for repositories inside the ``crate.yml`` file under
   ``path.repo`` as list of strings.

.. rubric:: Parameters

.. _ref-create-repository-types-fs-location:

**location**
  | *Type:*    ``text``
  | *Required*

  An absolute or relative path to the directory where snapshots get stored. If
  the path is relative, it will be appended to the first entry in the
  :ref:`path.repo <path.repo>` setting.

  Windows UNC paths are allowed, if server name and shares are specified and
  backslashes properly escaped.

``s3``
------

A repository that stores its snapshot on the Amazon S3 service. When used in
conjunction with Amazon IAM Roles, ``access_key`` and ``secret_key`` must be
