ALTER TABLE
===========

Alter an existing table

Synopsis
========

::

    ALTER [BLOB] TABLE table_name [ PARTITION (partition_column = value [ , ... ]) ]
      { SET ( parameter = value [ , ... ] )
        | RESET ( parameter [ , ... ] )
        | ADD [ COLUMN ] column_name data_type [ column_constraint [ ... ] ]
      }

where ``column_constraint`` is::

    { PRIMARY KEY |
      INDEX { OFF | USING { PLAIN |
                            FULLTEXT [ WITH ( analyzer = analyzer_name ) ]  }
    }

Description
===========

ALTER TABLE can be used to alter an existing table.

``SET`` can be used to change a table parameter to a different value. Using
``RESET`` will reset the parameter to its default value.

``ADD COLUMN`` can be used to add an additional column to a table.

Use the ``BLOB`` keyword in order to alter a blob table (see
:ref:`blob_support`). Blob tables cannot have custom columns which means that
the ``ADD COLUMN`` keyword won't work.

Parameters
==========

:table_name: The name of the table to alter.

:parameter: The name of the parameter that is set to a new value or its default.

:column_name: Name of the column which should be added.

:data_type: data type of the column which should be added.

See the CREATE TABLE :ref:`with_clause` for a list of available parameters.

PRIMARY KEY Constraint
======================

The PRIMARY KEY constraint specifies that a column or columns of a
table can contain only unique (non-duplicate), non-null values.

Adding a PRIMARY KEY column is only possible if the table is empty.

.. warning::

    The verification if the table is empty and the schema update isn't atomic.
    That means that it could be possible to add a primary key column to a table
    that isn't empty.
    If that is the case queries that contain the primary key columns in the
    WHERE clause will not behave as expected.

PARTITION Clause
================

If the table is partitioned this clause can be used to alter only a single partition.

.. note:: blob tables cannot be partitioned and hence this clause cannot be used.

This clause identifies a single partition. It takes one ore more partition
columns with a value each to identify the partition to alter.

::

    [ PARTITION ( partition_column = value [ , ... ] ) ]


:partition_column: The name of the column by which the table is partitioned.
                   All partition columns that were part of the
                   :ref:`partitioned_by_clause` of the :ref:`ref-create-table`
                   statement must be specified.

:value: The columns value.
