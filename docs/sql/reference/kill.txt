KILL ALL
========


Kills all active jobs in the crate cluster.


Synopsis
========

::

    KILL ALL


Description
===========


The ``KILL ALL`` statement will kill all active jobs within the crate cluster.


Be aware that Crate doesn't have transactions. If an operation which modifies
data is killed it won't rollback. For example if a update operation is killed
it is likely that it updated some documents before being killed. This might
leave the data in an inconsistent state. So take care when using ``KILL ALL``.


In addition to that certain fast running operations have a small time frame in
which they can be killed. For example if you delete a single document by id it
could be that the document is deleted before the ``KILL`` command is being
processed, but the client might still get an error that the operation has been
killed because the ``KILL`` command is processed before the final result is
sent to the client.
