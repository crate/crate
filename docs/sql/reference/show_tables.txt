===========
SHOW TABLES
===========

Lists the tables in the database.

Synopsis
========

::

    SHOW TABLES [{FROM | IN} schema_name] [LIKE 'pattern']

Description
===========

``SHOW TABLES`` can be used to retrieve the table names of the database in 
alphabetical order. The same list can be fetched by querying table names of the 
``information_schema.tables`` table.

System and BLOB tables are only listed when they are explicitly specified in 
``FROM | IN`` clause.

Parameters
==========

:schema_name: The name of the schema the tables are appropriate to.

LIKE Clause
===========

The optional ``LIKE`` clause indicates which table names to match. It takes a 
string pattern as a filter and has an equivalent behavior to 
:ref:`sql_dql_like`.

.. note::

    Schema names are ignored in the filter that is defined in the ``LIKE`` 
    clause.
