===========
SET / RESET
===========

Alter and restore global cluster configuration values at runtime.

Synopsis
========

::

    SET GLOBAL [ PERSISTENT | TRANSIENT ] parameter = value [ , ... ]

    RESET GLOBAL [ PERSISTENT | TRANSIENT ] parameter [ , ... ]

Description
===========

Using the ``SET`` and ``RESET`` statements it is possible to configure the
crate cluster at runtime.

``SET`` can be used to change a configuration parameter to a different value.
Using ``RESET`` will reset the parameter to its default value.

Parameters
==========

:parameter: The name of the configuration parameter to set / reset.

:value: the value to set for the configuration parameter


Supported Configuration Parameters
==================================

:collect_stats: a boolean indicating whether or not to collect statistical information
                about the cluster.

:jobs_log_size: the number of jobs kept in the ``sys.jobs_log`` table on each node for performance analytics.
                Older entries will be deleted when the ``jobs_log_size`` is reached.
                A single SQL statement results in a job to be executed on the cluster.
                A higher number results in more expressive results but also in more
                occupied RAM. Setting it to ``0`` disables collecting job information.

:operations_log_size: the number of operations to keep in the ``sys.operations_log`` table
                on each node for performance analytics.
                Older entries will be deleted when the ``operations_log_size`` is reached.
                A job consists of one or many operations.
                A higher number results in more expressive results but also in more
                occupied RAM.
                Setting it to ``0`` disables collecting operation information.

Persistence
===========

The default is ``TRANSIENT``. Settings that are changed using the ``TRANSIENT``
keyword will be lost if the cluster is stopped or restarted.

Using the ``PERSISTENT`` keyword will persist the changes to disk so that the
change will survive cluster restarts.
