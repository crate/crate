=======
COPY TO
=======

Export Table Contents to files on crate node machines.

Synopsis
========

::

    COPY table_ident [ column (, ...) ] TO [DIRECTORY] { output_uri }
    [ WITH ( copy_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]

Description
===========

Copy the contents of a table to one or many files on any cluster node
containing data from the given table.

.. note::

  Output files will always be stored on the cluster node machines, not
  on the client machine.

The created files are JSON formatted and contain one table row per
line.

If the ``DIRECTORY`` keyword is given, the uri is treated as a directory path.
This will generate one or more files in the given directory, named in such a
way to prevent filename conflicts.

Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to
  be exported.

:column: (optional) A list of column expressions that should be exported.

.. note::

    Declaring columns changes the output to JSON list format, which is
    currently not supported by the COPY FROM statement.

Output URI
==========

The ``output_uri`` can be any expression evaluating to a string.
The resulting string should be a valid URI of one of the supporting schemes:

 * ``file://``
 * ``s3://[<accesskey>:<secretkey>@]<bucketname>/<path>``

If no scheme is given (e.g.: '/path/to/file') the default uri-scheme ``file://``
will be used.

.. note::

    If the s3 scheme is used without specifying any credentials an attempt is
    made to read these information from the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
    AWS_SECRET_KEY environment variables. In addition to that the Java System
    properties aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey are also used as a fallback.

WITH Clause
===========

The optional WITH clause can specify parameters for the copy statement.

::

    [ WITH ( copy_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]

Possible copy_parameters are:

.. _compression:

compression
-----------

Per default no compression is applied.

Possible values for the ``compression`` setting are:

:gzip: The exported data is compressed with gzip_.
