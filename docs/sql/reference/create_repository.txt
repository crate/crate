=================
CREATE REPOSITORY
=================

Register a new repository that is used to store, manage and restore snapshots.

Synopsis
========

::

    CREATE REPOSITORY repository_name TYPE type
    [ WITH (repository_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]


Description
===========

CREATE REPOSITORY will register a new repository in the cluster.

.. note::

    If the repository configuration points to a location with existing snapshots,
    these are made available to the cluster.

Repositories are declared using a ``repository_name`` and ``type``.
Further configuration parameters are given in the WITH Clause.

Parameters
==========

:repository_name: the name of the repository as identifier

:type: the type of the repository, see :ref:`ref-create-repository-types`.


WITH Clause
===========

::

    [ WITH (repository_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]

The following configuration parameters apply to repositories of all types.
For further configuration options see the documentation of the used
repository ``type`` (e.g. type :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-fs`).

:max_restore_bytes_per_sec: The maximum rate at which snapshots are restored on
                            a single node from this repository.
                            Default: ``40mb`` per second.

:max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec: The maximum rate at which snapshots are created on
                             a single node to this repository.
                             Default: ``40mb`` per second.

.. _ref-create-repository-types:

Types
=====

A type determines how and where a repository stores its snapshots.
The supported types are the following. More types are supported via :ref:`plugins`.

.. _ref-create-repository-types-fs:

fs
--

A repository storing its snapshots to a shared filesystem that must be accessible
by all master and data nodes in the cluster.


.. note::

    In order to create repositories of this type, it is necessary to configure
    the possible locations for repositories inside the ``crate.yml`` file
    under ``path.repo`` as list of strings.

Configuration parameters:

.. _ref-create-repository-types-fs-location:

location
~~~~~~~~

**Required**

An absolute or relative path to the directory where snapshots get stored.
If the path is relative, it will be appended to the first entry in the
:ref:`path.repo <conf-path-repo>` setting.

Windows UNC paths are allowed as well, given server name and share are specified
and backslashes are properly escaped.

Only paths starting with an entry from :ref:`path.repo <conf-path-repo>` are possible.

compress
~~~~~~~~

``true`` (Default) or ``false``.

Whether the metadata part of the snapshot should be compressed or not.
The actual table data is not compressed.

chunk_size
~~~~~~~~~~

Defines the maximum size of a single file that gets created during snapshot creation.
Defaults to ``null``. So big files will not be split up into smaller chunks.


.. _ref-create-repository-types-hdfs:

hdfs
----

A repository that stores its snapshot inside an HDFS file-system.

uri
~~~

HDFS uri of the form ``hdfs:// <host>:<port>/`` (Optional).
If not given, the default filesystem URI for the given Hadoop HDFS configuration
is used.

user
~~~~

The HDFS user as string (Optional).

path
~~~~

HDFS filesystem path to where the data gets stored.

load_defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``true`` (Default) or ``false``

Whether or not to load the default Hadoop Configuration.

conf_location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comma separated string of files to Hadoop XML configuration files to load.

conf.<key>
~~~~~~~~~~

dynamic config values added to the Hadoop configuration.

concurrent_streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of concurrent streams to use for backup and restore (Default: 5).

compress
~~~~~~~~

``true`` (Default) or ``false``.

Whether the metadata part of the snapshot should be compressed or not.
The actual table data is not compressed.

chunk_size
~~~~~~~~~~

Defines the maximum size of a single file that gets created during snapshot creation.
Defaults to ``null``. So big files will not be split up into smaller chunks.

.. _ref-create-repository-types-url:

url
---

A read-only repository that points to the location of
a :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-fs` repository via "http", "https", "ftp",
"file" and "jar" urls. It only allows for :ref:`ref-restore-snapshot` operations.


url
~~~

This url must point to the root of the shared :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-fs`
repository.

Due to security reasons only URLs that are whitelisted can be used. URLs can be
whitelisted in the ``crate.yml`` configuration file. See
:ref:`ref-configuration-repositories`.
