=================
CREATE REPOSITORY
=================

Register a new repository that is used to store, manage and restore snapshots.

Synopsis
========

::

    CREATE REPOSITORY repository_name TYPE type
    [ WITH (repository_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]


Description
===========

``CREATE REPOSITORY`` will register a new repository in the cluster.

.. note::

    If the repository configuration points to a location with existing snapshots,
    these are made available to the cluster.

Repositories are declared using a ``repository_name`` and ``type``.
Further configuration parameters are given in the WITH Clause.

Parameters
==========

:repository_name: the name of the repository as identifier

:type: the type of the repository, see :ref:`ref-create-repository-types`.


WITH Clause
===========

::

    [ WITH (repository_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]

The following configuration parameters apply to repositories of all types.
For further configuration options see the documentation of the used
repository ``type`` (e.g. type :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-fs`).

:max_restore_bytes_per_sec: The maximum rate at which snapshots are restored on
                            a single node from this repository.
                            Default: ``40mb`` per second.

:max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec: The maximum rate at which snapshots are created on
                             a single node to this repository.
                             Default: ``40mb`` per second.

.. _ref-create-repository-types:

Types
=====

A type determines how and where a repository stores its snapshots.
The supported types are the following. More types are supported via :ref:`plugins`.

.. _ref-create-repository-types-fs:

fs
--

A repository storing its snapshots to a shared filesystem that must be accessible
by all master and data nodes in the cluster.


.. note::

    In order to create repositories of this type, it is necessary to configure
    the possible locations for repositories inside the ``crate.yml`` file
    under ``path.repo`` as list of strings.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

.. _ref-create-repository-types-fs-location:

location  (**Required**)  
  An absolute or relative path to the directory where snapshots get stored.
  If the path is relative, it will be appended to the first entry in the
  :ref:`path.repo <conf-path-repo>` setting.

  Windows UNC paths are allowed as well, given server name and share are specified
  and backslashes are properly escaped.

  Only paths starting with an entry from :ref:`path.repo <conf-path-repo>` are possible.

compress
  ``true`` (Default) or ``false``.

  Whether the metadata part of the snapshot should be compressed or not.
  The actual table data is not compressed.

chunk_size
  Defines the maximum size of a single file that gets created during snapshot creation.
  Defaults to ``null``. So big files will not be split up into smaller chunks.

.. _ref-create-repository-types-hdfs:

hdfs
----

A repository that stores its snapshot inside an HDFS file-system.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

uri
  HDFS uri of the form ``hdfs:// <host>:<port>/`` (optional).
  
  If not given, the default filesystem URI for the given Hadoop HDFS configuration
  is used.

user
  The HDFS user as string (optional).  

path
  HDFS filesystem path to where the data gets stored.  
  
load_defaults
  ``true`` (Default) or ``false``.  
  
  Whether or not to load the default Hadoop Configuration.  
  
conf_location
  Comma separated string of files to Hadoop XML configuration files to load.  
  
conf.<key>
  dynamic config values added to the Hadoop configuration.  
  
concurrent_streams
  The number of concurrent streams to use for backup and restore (Default: 5).  
  
compress
  ``true`` (Default) or ``false``.  
  
  Whether the metadata part of the snapshot should be compressed or not.
  The actual table data is not compressed.
  
chunk_size
  Defines the maximum size of a single file that gets created during snapshot creation.
  Defaults to ``null``. So big files will not be split up into smaller chunks.

.. _ref-create-repository-types-s3:

s3
--

A repository that stores its snapshot on the Amazon S3 service.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

bucket
  Name of the S3 bucket to be used for storing snapshots. If the bucket
  does not yet exist, a new bucket will be created on S3 (assuming the
  required permissions are set).

region
  Region where the bucket is located. This defaults to ``us-east-1``

endpoint
  Endpoint to the S3 API. This defaults to AWS's default API endpoint.
  Setting a region will override the endpoint setting.

protocol
  Protocol to be used (``http`` or ``https``). This defaults to ``https``

base_path
  Path within the bucket to the repository.

access_key
  Access key used for authentication. Defaults to the globally defined
  environmental variable.

secret_key
  Secret key used for authentication. Defaults to the globally defined
  environmental variable.

concurrent_streams
  The number of concurrent streams to use for backup and restore (Default: 5).

chunk_size
  Defines the maximum size of a single file that gets created during snapshot creation.
  Defaults to ``null``. So big files will not be split up into smaller chunks.

compress
  ``true`` (Default) or ``false``.

  Whether the metadata part of the snapshot should be compressed or not.
  The actual table data is not compressed.

server_side_encryption
  ``false`` (Default) or ``true``.

  If this is set to ``true``, files are encrypted on the server side using the
  ``AES256`` algorithm.

buffer_size
  Minimum threshold below which chunks are uploaded with a single request.
  If the threshold is exceeded, the chunks will be split into multiple parts
  of ``buffer_size`` length. Each chunk will be uploaded separately. The
  minimum allowed value is ``5mb``. which is also the default.

max_retries
  Number of retries in case of errors. Defaults to ``3``.

read_only
  ``false`` (Default) or ``true``.

  If set to ``true`` the repository is made read-only.

canned_acl
  ``private`` (Default), ``public-read``, ``public-read-write``,
  ``authenticated-read``, ``log-delivery-write``, ``bucket-owner-read``, or
  ``bucket-owner-full-control``

  When the repository creates buckets and objects, the specified canned ACL
  is added.

.. _ref-create-repository-types-url:

url
---

A read-only repository that points to the location of
a :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-fs` repository via "http", "https", "ftp",
"file" and "jar" urls. It only allows for :ref:`ref-restore-snapshot` operations.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

url
  This url must point to the root of the shared :ref:`ref-create-repository-types-fs`
  repository.

  Due to security reasons only URLs that are whitelisted can be used. URLs can be
  whitelisted in the ``crate.yml`` configuration file. See
  :ref:`ref-configuration-repositories`.
