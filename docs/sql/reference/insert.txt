Synopsis
========

::

    INSERT INTO table_ident
      [ ( column_ident [, ...] ) ]
      { VALUES ( expression [, ...] ) [, ...] | query }
      [ ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
        { column_ident = expression } [, ...]
      ]

Description
===========

INSERT creates one or more rows specified by value expressions.

The target column names can be listed in any order. If no list of
column names is given at all, the default is all the columns of the
table in lexical order; or the first N column names, if there are only
N columns supplied by the VALUES clause. The values supplied by the
VALUES clause are associated with the explicit or implicit column list
left-to-right.

Each column not present in the explicit or implicit column list will
not be filled.

If the expression for any column is not of the correct data type,
automatic type conversion will be attempted.

On Duplicate Key Update
-----------------------

If ``ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`` is specified and a row is inserted that
would cause a duplicate-key conflict, an update of the existing
row is performed.

::

      ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE { column_ident = expression } [, ...]

Within expressions in the ``UPDATE`` clause you can use the
``VALUES(column_ident)`` function to refer to column values
from the INSERT statement.
So ``VALUES(column_ident)`` in the ``UPDATE`` clause referes to the
value of the column_ident that would be inserted if no duplicate-key
conflict occured.
This function is especially useful in multiple-row inserts, because
the values of the current row can be referenced.

Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The identifier (optionally schema-qualified) of an
    existing table.

:column_ident: The name of a column or field in the table pointed to
   by table_ident.

:expression: An expression or value to assign to the corresponding column.
   Within a ``ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`` clause the expression may also refer
   to an expression from VALUES by using ``VALUES ( column_ident )``

:query: A query (SELECT statement) that supplies the rows to be
        inserted. Refer to the ``SELECT`` statement for a description of the syntax.
