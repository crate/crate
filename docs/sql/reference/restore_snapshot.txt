RESTORE SNAPSHOT
================

Restore a snapshot into the cluster.

Synopsis
========

::

    RESTORE SNAPSHOT repository_name.snapshot_name
    { TABLE ( table_ident [ PARTITION (partition_column = value [ , ... ])] [, ...] ) | ALL }
    [ WITH (restore_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]


Description
===========

Restore one or more tables or partitions from an existing snapshot into the cluster.
The snapshot must be given as fully qualified reference with ``repository_name``
and ``snapshot_name``.

It is possible to restore all tables contained in the snapshot using the ``ALL``
keyword. Single tables and/or partitions can be selected for restoring by giving them
as ``table_ident`` or partition reference given the ``partition_column`` values.

It is possible to change the table names that get restored and to change the
table settings of the restored table.

Tables that are to be restored may not exist yet.

Parameters
==========

:repository_name: the name of the repository of the snapshot to restore as ident

:snapshot_name: the name of the snapshot as ident

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing
              table that is to be restored from the snapshot

:partition_column: Column name by which the table is partitioned

WITH Clause
===========

::

    [ WITH (restore_parameter [= value], [, ...]) ]

The following configuration parameters can be used to modify how the snapshot is
restored to the cluster:

:ignore_unavailable: (Default ``false``) Per default the restore command fails if a table
                     is given that does not exist in the snapshot. If set to ``true`` those
                     missing tables are ignored.

:wait_for_completion: (Default: ``false``) By default the request returns once the restore
                      operation started. If set to ``true`` the request returns after all
                      selected tables from the snapshot are restored or an error occurred.
                      This can take a serious amount of time.

:target_schema: an expression that evaluates to the ``schema_name`` of the table to restore.
                The expression given here can take references like ``table_name``
                and ``schema_name`` as inputs and e.g. apply a function on it.

:target_table: an expression that evaluates to the ``table_name`` of the table to restore.
               The expression given here can take references like ``table_name``
               and ``schema_name`` as inputs and e.g. apply a function on it.
