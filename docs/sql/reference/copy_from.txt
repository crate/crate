COPY FROM
=========

Copy data from files into a table.

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: sql

    COPY table_ident FROM 'path' [ WITH ( option = value [, ...] ) ]

Description
===========

COPY FROM copies data from the filesystem of any cluster node to a
specified table.

The files to be copied from need to be accessible from the crate
server process and the name must be specified from the viewpoint of
the server.

The input files need to have one line per record. Records are
formatted in JSON.

For examples see: :ref:`importing_data`.

Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing
    table where the data should be put.

:path: A file or directory path, it is based on the absolute path of the node's
data location. The filename may contain globbing wildcards.


WITH Clause
===========

The optional ``WITH`` clause can specify options for the COPY FROM statement.

.. code-block:: sql

    [ WITH ( option = value [, ...] ) ]

where ``option`` can be one of:

bulk_size
~~~~~~~~~

Crate will process the lines it reads from the ``path`` in bulks. This option
specifies the size of such a bulk. The default is 10000.

.. warning::

    A bulk_size that is too high will cause a very high load on the cluster and
    some lines that should be inserted might even be dropped.

concurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of parallel bulk actions that should be executed. Default is 4.

.. warning::

    Similar to a high bulk_size a high concurrency setting will cause a very
    high load on the cluster.
