=========
COPY FROM
=========

Copy data from files into a table.

Synopsis
========

::

    COPY table_ident FROM uri [ WITH ( option = value [, ...] ) ]

where `option` can be one of:

- `bulk_size` *integer*
- `concurrency` *integer*
- `shared` *boolean*
- `num_readers` *integer*
- `compression` *string*

Description
===========

COPY FROM copies data from a URI to the specified table.

The nodes in the cluster will attempt to access the resources available under
the URI and import the data.

The file(s) must contain one JSON formatted row per line.

For examples see: :ref:`importing_data`.


Supported URI Schemes
=====================

file
----

The default scheme used if the scheme isn't part of the used URI.

The filepath given must be an absolute path and accessable by the crate
process.

By default each node will attempt to read the files specified. If the URI
points to a shared folder the ``shared`` option must be set to true in order to
avoid duplicate imports.


s3
--

Can be used to access buckets on the Amazon AWS S3 Service:

.. code-block:: text

    s3://[<accesskey>:<secretkey>]@<bucketname>/<path>

If the accesskey and secret key is ommited an attempt to load the credentials
from the environment or java settings is made.

Environment Variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_KEY
Java System Properties - aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey

Using a s3 URI will set the ``shared`` option implicitly.


Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing
    table where the data should be put.

:uri: An expression which evaluates to a uri as defined in `RFC2396`_. The
      supported schemes are listed above. The last part of the path may also
      contain ``*`` wildcards to match multiple files.

WITH Clause
===========

The optional ``WITH`` clause can specify options for the COPY FROM statement.

::

    [ WITH ( option = value [, ...] ) ]

Options
-------

bulk_size
^^^^^^^^^

Crate will process the lines it reads from the ``path`` in bulks. This option
specifies the size of such a bulk. The default is 10000.

Must be set to a number greater than 0

.. warning::

    A bulk_size that is too high will cause a very high load on the cluster and
    some lines that should be inserted might even be dropped.

concurrency
^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of parallel bulk actions that should be executed. Default is 4.
Must be set to a number greater than 0.

.. warning::

    Similar to a high bulk_size a high concurrency setting will cause a very
    high load on the cluster.

shared
^^^^^^

This option should be set if the URI points to a shared storage. It will
prevent multiple nodes/readers from importing the same file.

The default value depends on the used URI scheme.

num_readers
^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of nodes that will read the resources specified in the URI. Defaults
to the number of nodes available in the cluster. If the option is set to a
number greater than the number of available nodes it will still only use each
node only once to do the import.

Must be an integer that is greater than 0.

compression
^^^^^^^^^^^

The default value is ``null``. Can be set to ``gzip`` to read gzipped files.
