SELECT
======

Retrieve rows from a table.

Synopsis
========

::

    SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] * | expression [ [ AS ] output_name ] [, ...]
      FROM [ schema_name . ] table_name [ [AS] table_alias ]
      [ WHERE condition ]
      [ GROUP BY expression [, ...] [HAVING condition] ]
      [ ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...] ]
      [ LIMIT num_results ]
      [ OFFSET start ]


Description
===========

SELECT retrieves rows from a table. The general processing of SELECT
is as follows:

- The FROM item points to the table where the data should be retrieved
  from.

- If the WHERE clause is specified, all rows that do not satisfy the
  condition are eliminated from the output. (See WHERE Clause below.)

- If the GROUP BY clause is specified, the output is combined into
  groups of rows that match on one or more values.

- The actual output rows are computed using the SELECT output
  expressions for each selected row or row group.

- If the ORDER BY clause is specified, the returned rows are sorted in
  the specified order. If ORDER BY is not given, the rows are returned
  in whatever order the system finds fastest to produce.

- If DISTINCT is specified, one unique row is kept. All other
  duplicate rows are removed from the result set.

- If the LIMIT or OFFSET clause is specified, the SELECT statement
  only returns a subset of the result rows.

Parameters
==========

SELECT List
-----------

The SELECT list specifies expressions that form the output rows of the
SELECT statement. The expressions can (and usually do) refer to
columns computed in the FROM clause.

::

    SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] * | expression [ [ AS ] output_name ] [, ...]

Just as in a table, every output column of a SELECT has a name. In a
simple SELECT this name is just used to label the column for
display. To specify the name to use for an output column, write AS
``output_name`` after the column's ``expression``. (You can omit AS,
but only if the desired output name does not match any reserved
keyword. For protection against possible future keyword additions, it
is recommended that you always either write AS or double-quote the
output name.) If you do not specify a column name, a name is chosen
automatically by Crate. If the column's expression is a simple column
reference then the chosen name is the same as that column's name. In
more complex cases a function or type name may be used, or the system
may fall back on a generated name.

An output column's name can be used to refer to the column's value in
ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses, but not in the WHERE clause; there you
must write out the expression instead.

Instead of an expression, ``*`` can be written in the output list as a
shorthand for all the columns of the selected rows. Also, you can
write table_name.* as a shorthand for the columns coming from just
that table. In these cases it is not possible to specify new names
with AS; the output column names will be the same as the table
columns' names.

FROM Clause
-----------

The FROM clause specifies the source table for the SELECT::

    FROM [ schema_name . ] table_name [ [AS] table_alias ]

:schema_name: (optional) The name of an existing schema. If no schema is provided,
    the ``doc`` schema will be used.

:table_name: The name of an existing table.

:table_alias: A substitute name for the FROM item containing the alias.
  An alias is used for brevity. When an alias is provided, it completely hides
  the actual name of the table. For example given ``FROM foo AS f``, the
  remainder of the SELECT must refer to this 'FROM' item as 'f' not 'foo'.


WHERE Clause
------------

The optional WHERE clause defines the condition to be met for a row to
be returned::

    WHERE condition

:condition: a where condition is any expression that evaluates to a
  result of type boolean. Any row that does not satisfy this condition
  will be eliminated from the output. A row satisfies the condition if
  it returns true when the actual row values are substituted for any
  variable references.

.. _sql_reference_group_by:

GROUP BY Clause
---------------

The optional GROUP BY clause will condense into a single row all
selected rows that share the same values for the grouped expressions.

Aggregate expressions, if any are used, are computed across all rows
making up each group, producing a separate value for each group.

::

    GROUP BY expression [, ...] [HAVING condition]

:expression: An arbitrary expression formed from column references
  of the queried relation that are also present in the result column list.
  Numeric literals are interpreted as ordinals referencing an output
  column from the select list.
  It can also reference output columns by name.
  In case of ambiguity, a GROUP BY name will be interpreted as a name of a
  column from the queried relation rather than an output column name.

.. _sql_reference_having:

HAVING Clause
.............

The optional HAVING clause defines the condition to be met for
values whitin a resulting row of a group by clause.

:condition: a having condition is any expression that evaluates to a result
    of type boolean. Every row for which the condition is not satisfied
    will be eliminated from the output.


.. note::

  When GROUP BY is present, it is not valid for the SELECT list
  expressions to refer to ungrouped columns except within aggregate
  functions, since there would otherwise be more than one possible
  value to return for an ungrouped column.

.. note::

  Grouping can only be applied on indexed fields. For more information,
  please refer to :ref:`sql_ddl_index_off`.

.. _sql_reference_order_by:

ORDER BY Clause
---------------

The ORDER BY clause causes the result rows to be sorted according to
the specified expression(s).

::

    ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...]

:expression: can be the name or ordinal number of an output column, or
  it can be an arbitrary expression formed from input-column values.

The optional keyword ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending) after any
expression allows to define the direction in which values have are
sorted. The default is ascending.

If NULLS FIRST is specified, null values sort before non null values. If NULLS
LAST is specified null values sort after non null values.  If neither is
specified nulls are considered larger than any value. That means the default
for ASC is NULLS LAST and the default for DESC is NULLS FIRST.

.. note::

  If two rows are equal according to the leftmost expression, they are compared
  according to the next expression and so on. If they are equal according to
  all specified expressions, they are returned in an implementation-dependent
  order.

.. note::

  Sorting can only be applied on indexed fields. For more information,
  please refer to :ref:`sql_ddl_index_off`.

Character-string data is sorted by its UTF-8 representation.

LIMIT Clause
------------

The optional LIMIT Clause allows to limit the number or retured result rows::

    LIMIT num_results

:num_results: specifies the maximum number of result rows to return,
  the default is 10000.


.. note::

    It is possible for repeated executions of the same LIMIT query to
    return different subsets of the rows of a table, if there is not
    an ORDER BY to enforce selection of a deterministic subset.

OFFSET Clause
-------------

The optional OFFSET Clause allows to skip result rows at the beginning::

    OFFSET start

:start: specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.
