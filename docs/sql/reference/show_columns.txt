============
SHOW COLUMNS
============

``SHOW COLUMNS`` displays information about columns in a given table. 

Synopsis
========

::

    SHOW COLUMNS {FROM |Â IN} table_name [FROM | IN schema_name] [LIKE 'pattern']

Description
===========

``SHOW COLUMNS`` fetches all column names of a given table and displays their 
detailed information. The column names are listed in alphabetical order. 
The same list can be fetched by querying the ``information_schema.columns`` 
table.

Parameters
==========

:table_name:  The name of the table of which the column information is printed.

:schema_name: The name of the schema the tables are appropriate to. If no 
              schema name is specified the default schema is set to ``doc``.

LIKE Clause
===========

The optional ``LIKE`` clause indicates which table names to match. It takes a 
string pattern as a filter and has an equivalent behavior to 
:ref:`sql_dql_like`.

.. note::

    Schema names are ignored in the filter that is defined in the ``LIKE`` 
    clause.
