============
Blob Support
============

Crate includes support to store `binary large objects`_. By utilizing
Crate's cluster features the files can be replicated and sharded just
like regular data.

Any index can hold blobs if enabled. To enable blobs on an index the
``blobs.enabled`` flag needs to be set to true like this::

    sh$ curl -sSX PUT 'localhost:4200/myblobs?pretty' -d '{
    ... "number_of_shards": 3,
    ... "number_of_replicas": 1,
    ... "blobs.enabled": true}'
    {
      "ok" : true,
      "acknowledged" : true
    }

Now crate is configured to allow blobs to be management under the index's
``_blobs`` endpoint.

Uploading
---------

To upload a blob the sha1 hash of the blob has to be known upfront
since this has to be used as the id of the new blob. For this example
we use a fancy python one-liner to compute the shasum::

    sh$ python -c 'import hashlib;print(hashlib.sha1("contents".encode("utf-8")).hexdigest())'
    4a756ca07e9487f482465a99e8286abc86ba4dc7

The blob can now be uploaded by issuing a PUT request::

    sh$ curl -isSX PUT 'localhost:4200/myblobs/_blobs/4a756ca07e9487f482465a99e8286abc86ba4dc7' -d 'contents'
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Content-Length: 0

If a blob already exists with the given hash a 409 Conflict is returned::

    sh$ curl -isSX PUT 'localhost:4200/myblobs/_blobs/4a756ca07e9487f482465a99e8286abc86ba4dc7' -d 'contents'
    HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
    Content-Length: 0

Download
--------

To download a blob simply use a GET request::

    sh$ curl -sS 'localhost:4200/myblobs/_blobs/4a756ca07e9487f482465a99e8286abc86ba4dc7'
    contents

.. note::

    Since the blobs are sharded throughout the cluster not every node has all
    the blobs. In case that the GET request has been sent to a node that
    doesn't contain the requested file it will respond with a 307 Temporary
    Redirect which will lead to a node that does contain the file.

If the blob doesn't exist a 404 Not Found error is returned::

    sh$ curl -isS 'localhost:4200/myblobs/_blobs/e5fa44f2b31c1fb553b6021e7360d07d5d91ff5e'
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Content-Length: 0

To determine if a blob exists without downloading it, a HEAD request can be
used::

    sh$ curl -sS -I 'localhost:4200/myblobs/_blobs/4a756ca07e9487f482465a99e8286abc86ba4dc7'
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: 8
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    Expires: Thu, 31 Dec 2037 23:59:59 GMT
    Cache-Control: max-age=315360000

.. note::

    The cache headers for blobs are static and basically allows clients to
    cache the response forever since the blob is immutable.

Delete
------

To delete a blob simply use a DELETE request::

    sh$ curl -isS -XDELETE 'localhost:4200/myblobs/_blobs/4a756ca07e9487f482465a99e8286abc86ba4dc7'
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Content-Length: 0

If the blob doesn't exist a 404 Not Found error is returned::

    sh$ curl -isS -XDELETE 'localhost:4200/myblobs/_blobs/4a756ca07e9487f482465a99e8286abc86ba4dc7'
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Content-Length: 0
