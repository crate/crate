First Steps
===========

- In order to get Crate up and running take a look at the `installation.txt`
  and `configuration.txt` file.

- If you are new to Crate, it is probably the best to take a look at
  `hello.txt`.

- Take a look at the `sql.txt` and `inout.txt` as well as
  `3rd-party-plugins.txt`
