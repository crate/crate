Introduction
============

Window functions are functions which perform a computation across a set of rows
which are related to the current row. This is comparable to aggregation
functions, but window functions do not cause multiple rows to be grouped
into a single row.

.. _window-function-call:

Window Function Call
====================

Synopsis
--------

The synopsis of a window function call is one of the following

::

   function_name ([expression [, expression ... ]])
                 [ FILTER ( WHERE condition ) ]
                 over_clause
   function_name ( * ) [ FILTER ( WHERE condition ) ] over_clause

where ``function_name`` is a name of
a :ref:`general-purpose window <general-purpose-window-functions>` or
:ref:`aggregate <aggregate-functions>` function 
and ``expression`` is a column reference, scalar function or literal.

If ``FILTER`` is specified, then only the rows that met the
:ref:`sql_dql_where_clause` condition are supplied to the window
function. Only window functions that are :ref:`aggregates <aggregation>`
accept the ``FILTER`` clause.

The :ref:`over` clause is what declares a function to be a window function.

The window function call that uses a ``wildcard`` instead of an ``expression`` as
a function argument is supported only by the ``count(*)`` aggregate function.

.. _window-definition:

Window Definition
=================

.. _over:

OVER
----

Synopsis
........

::

   OVER { window_name | ( [ window_definition ] ) }

where ``window_definition`` has the syntax

::

   window_definition:
      [ window_name ]
      [ PARTITION BY expression [, ...] ]
      [ ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...] ]
      [ { RANGE | ROWS } BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end ]

The ``window_name`` refers to ``window_definition`` defined in the
:ref:`sql_reference_window` clause.

The ``frame_start`` and ``frame_end`` can be one of

::

   UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
   offset PRECEDING
   CURRENT ROW
   offset FOLLOWING
   UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

The default frame definition is ``RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT
ROW``. If ``frame_end`` is omitted it defaults to ``CURRENT ROW``.

``frame_start`` cannot be ``FOLLOWING`` or ``UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`` and
``frame_end`` cannot be ``PRECEDING`` or ``UNBOUNDED PRECEDING``.

In ``RANGE`` mode if the ``frame_start`` is ``CURRENT ROW`` the frame starts
with the current row's first peer (a row that the window's ``ORDER BY``
expression sorts as equal to the current row), while a ``frame_end`` of
``CURRENT ROW`` means the frame will end with the current's row last peer row.

In ``ROWS`` mode ``CURRENT_ROW`` means the current row.

The ``offset PRECEDING`` and ``offset FOLLOWING`` options vary in meaning
depending on the frame mode. In ``ROWS`` mode, the ``offset`` is an integer
indicating that the frame start or end is offsetted by that many rows before or
after the current row. In ``RANGE`` mode, the use of a custom ``offset``
option requires that there is exactly one ``ORDER BY`` column in the window
definition. The frame contains those rows whose ordering column value is no
more than ``offset`` minus (for PRECEDING) or plus (for FOLLOWING) the current
row's ordering column value. Because the value of ``offset`` is substracted/added
to the values of the ordering column, only type combinations that support
addition/substraction operations are allowed. For instance, when the ordering
column is of type :ref:`timestamp <timestamp_data_type>`, the ``offset``
expression can be an :ref:`interval <interval_data_type>`.

The ``OVER`` clause defines the ``window`` containing the appropriate rows
which will take part in the ``window function`` computation.

An empty ``OVER`` clause defines a ``window`` containing all the rows in the
result set.

Example::

   cr> SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) OVER() AS cnt FROM employees ORDER BY 1, 2;
   +---------+-----+
   | dept_id | cnt |
   +---------+-----+
   |    4001 |  18 |
   |    4001 |  18 |
   |    4001 |  18 |
   |    4002 |  18 |
   |    4002 |  18 |
   |    4002 |  18 |
   |    4002 |  18 |
   |    4003 |  18 |
   |    4003 |  18 |
   |    4003 |  18 |
   |    4003 |  18 |
   |    4003 |  18 |
   |    4004 |  18 |
   |    4004 |  18 |
   |    4004 |  18 |
   |    4006 |  18 |
   |    4006 |  18 |
   |    4006 |  18 |
   +---------+-----+
   SELECT 18 rows in set (... sec)

The ``PARTITION BY`` clause groups the rows within a window into
partitions which are processed separately by the window function, each
partition in turn becoming a window. If ``PARTITION BY`` is not specified, all
the rows are considered a single partition.

Example::

   cr> SELECT dept_id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY dept_id) AS row_num 
   ... FROM employees ORDER BY 1, 2;
   +---------+---------+
   | dept_id | row_num |
   +---------+---------+
   |    4001 |       1 |
   |    4001 |       2 |
   |    4001 |       3 |
   |    4002 |       1 |
   |    4002 |       2 |
   |    4002 |       3 |
   |    4002 |       4 |
   |    4003 |       1 |
   |    4003 |       2 |
   |    4003 |       3 |
   |    4003 |       4 |
   |    4003 |       5 |
   |    4004 |       1 |
   |    4004 |       2 |
   |    4004 |       3 |
   |    4006 |       1 |
   |    4006 |       2 |
   |    4006 |       3 |
   +---------+---------+
   SELECT 18 rows in set (... sec)

If ``ORDER BY`` is supplied the ``window`` definition consists of a range of
rows starting with the first row in the ``partition`` and ending with the
current row, plus any subsequent rows that are equal to the current row, which
are the current row's ``peers``.

Example::

   cr> SELECT
   ...   dept_id,
   ...   sex,
   ...   COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY sex) AS cnt
   ... FROM employees
   ... ORDER BY 1, 2, 3
   +---------+-----+-----+
   | dept_id | sex | cnt |
   +---------+-----+-----+
   |    4001 | M   |   3 |
   |    4001 | M   |   3 |
   |    4001 | M   |   3 |
   |    4002 | F   |   1 |
   |    4002 | M   |   4 |
   |    4002 | M   |   4 |
   |    4002 | M   |   4 |
   |    4003 | M   |   5 |
   |    4003 | M   |   5 |
   |    4003 | M   |   5 |
   |    4003 | M   |   5 |
   |    4003 | M   |   5 |
   |    4004 | F   |   1 |
   |    4004 | M   |   3 |
   |    4004 | M   |   3 |
   |    4006 | F   |   1 |
   |    4006 | M   |   3 |
   |    4006 | M   |   3 |
   +---------+-----+-----+
   SELECT 18 rows in set (... sec)

.. note::

   Taking into account the ``peers`` concept mentioned above, for an empty
   ``OVER`` clause all the rows in the result set are ``peers``.

.. note::

   :ref:`Aggregation functions <aggregation>` will be treated as
   ``window functions`` when used in conjunction with the ``OVER`` clause.

.. note::

   Window definitions order or partitioned by an array column type are
   currently not supported.

In the ``UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`` case the ``window`` for each row starts with
each row and ends with the last row in the current ``partition``. If the
``current row`` has ``peers`` the ``window`` will include (or start with) all
the ``current row`` peers and end at the upper bound of the ``partition``.

Example::

   cr> SELECT
   ...   dept_id,
   ...   sex,
   ...   COUNT(*) OVER(
   ...     PARTITION BY dept_id
   ...     ORDER BY
   ...       sex RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW
   ...       AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
   ...   ) partitionByDeptOrderBySex
   ... FROM employees
   ... ORDER BY 1, 2, 3

.. _named-windows:

Named windows
-------------

It is possible to define a list of named window definitions that can be
referenced in :ref:`over` clauses. To do this, use the
:ref:`sql_reference_window` clause in the :ref:`sql_reference_select` clause.

Named windows are particularly useful when the same window definition
could be used in multiple :ref:`over` clauses. For instance

::

   cr> SELECT
   ...   x,
   ...   FIRST_VALUE(x) OVER (w) AS "first",
   ...   LAST_VALUE(x) OVER (w) AS "last"
   ... FROM (VALUES (1), (2), (3), (4)) AS t(x)
   ... WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY x)
   +---+-------+------+
   | x | first | last |
   +---+-------+------+
   | 1 |     1 |    1 |
   | 2 |     1 |    2 |
   | 3 |     1 |    3 |
   | 4 |     1 |    4 |
   +---+-------+------+
   SELECT 4 rows in set (... sec)

If a ``window_name`` is specified in the window definition of the :ref:`over`
clause, then there must be a named window entry that matches the ``window_name``
in the window definition list of the :ref:`sql_reference_window` clause.

If the :ref:`over` clause has its own non-empty window definition and
references a window definition from the :ref:`sql_reference_window` clause,
then it can only add clauses from the referenced window, but not overwrite them.

::

   cr> SELECT
   ...   x,
   ...   LAST_VALUE(x) OVER (w ORDER BY x) AS y
   ... FROM (VALUES
   ...      (1, 1),
   ...      (2, 1),
   ...      (3, 2),
   ...      (4, 2) ) AS t(x, y)
   ... WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY y)
   +---+---+
   | x | y |
   +---+---+
   | 1 | 1 |
   | 2 | 2 |
   | 3 | 3 |
   | 4 | 4 |
   +---+---+
   SELECT 4 rows in set (... sec)

Otherwise, an attempt to override the clauses of the referenced window
by the window definition of the :ref:`OVER` clause will result in failure.

::

   cr> SELECT
   ...   FIRST_VALUE(x) OVER (w ORDER BY x)
   ... FROM (VALUES(1), (2), (3), (4)) as t(x)
   ... WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY x)
   SQLActionException[SQLParseException: Cannot override ORDER BY clause of window w]

It is not possible to define the ``PARTITION BY`` clause in the window
definition of the :ref:`OVER` clause if it references a window definition
from the :ref:`sql_reference_window` clause.

The window definitions in the :ref:`sql_reference_window` clause cannot define
its own window frames, if they are referenced by non-empty window definitions
of the :ref:`OVER` clauses.

The definition of the named window can itself begin with a ``window_name``.
In this case all the elements of inter-connected named windows will be copied
to the window definition of the :ref:`OVER` clause if it references the named
window definition that has subsequent window references. The window definitions
in the ``WINDOW`` clause permits only backward references.

::

   cr> SELECT
   ...   x,
   ...   ROW_NUMBER() OVER (w) AS y
   ... FROM (VALUES
   ...      (1, 1),

General-Purpose Window Functions
================================

``row_number()``
----------------

Returns the number of the current row within its window.

Example::

   cr> SELECT 
   ...  col1, 
   ...  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY col1) as row_num
   ... FROM (VALUES('x'), ('y'), ('z')) AS t;

.. _window-function-firstvalue:

``first_value(arg)``
--------------------

.. note::

   The ``first_value`` window function is an :ref:`enterprise
   feature <enterprise-features>`.

Returns the argument value evaluated at the first row within the window.

Its return type is the type of its argument.

Example::

   cr> SELECT 
   ...  col1, 
   ...  FIRST_VALUE(col1) OVER (ORDER BY col1) AS value
   ... FROM (VALUES('x'), ('y'), ('y'), ('z')) AS t;

   SELECT 4 rows in set (... sec)

.. _window-function-lastvalue:

``last_value(arg)``
-------------------

.. note::

   The ``last_value`` window function is an :ref:`enterprise
   feature <enterprise-features>`.

Returns the argument value evaluated at the last row within the window.

Its return type is the type of its argument.

Example::

   cr> SELECT

.. _window-function-nthvalue:

``nth_value(arg, number)``
--------------------------

.. note::

   The ``nth_value`` window function is an :ref:`enterprise
   feature <enterprise-features>`.

Returns the argument value evaluated at row that is the nth row within the
window. Null is returned if the nth row doesn't exist in the window.

Its return type is the type of its first argument.

Example::

   cr> SELECT 
   ...  col1, 
   ...  NTH_VALUE(col1, 3) OVER(ORDER BY col1) AS val
   ... FROM (VALUES ('x'), ('y'), ('y'), ('z')) AS t;

.. _window-function-lag:

``lag(arg [, offset [, default] ])``
------------------------------------

.. note::

   The ``lag`` window function is an :ref:`enterprise feature
   <enterprise-features>`.

Synopsis
........

::

   lag(argument any [, offset integer [, default any]])

Returns the argument value evaluated at the row that precedes the current row
by the offset within the partition. If there is no such row, the return value
is ``default``. If ``offset`` or ``default`` arguments are missing, they
default to ``1`` and ``null``, respectively.

Both ``offset`` and ``default`` are evaluated with respect to the current row.

If ``offset`` is ``0``, then argument value is evaluated for the current row.

The ``default`` and ``argument`` data types must match.

Example::

   cr> SELECT
   ...   dept_id,
   ...   year,
   ...   budget,
   ...   LAG(budget) OVER(

.. _window-function-lead:

``lead(arg [, offset [, default] ])``
-------------------------------------

.. note::

   The ``lead`` window function is an :ref:`enterprise feature
   <enterprise-features>`.

Synopsis
........

::

   lead(argument any [, offset integer [, default any]])

The ``lead`` function is the counterpart of the
:ref:`lag window function <window-function-lag>` as it allows the evaluation of
the argument at rows that follow the current row. ``lead`` returns the argument
value evaluated at the row that follows the current row by the offset within
the partition. If there is no such row, the return value is ``default``.
If ``offset`` or ``default`` arguments are missing, they default to ``1`` and
``null``, respectively.

Both ``offset`` and ``default`` are evaluated with respect to the current row.

If ``offset`` is ``0``, then argument value is evaluated for the current row.

The ``default`` and ``argument`` data types must match.

Example::

   cr> SELECT
   ...   dept_id,
   ...   year,
   ...   budget,
   ...   LEAD(budget) OVER(
   ...      PARTITION BY dept_id) next_budget
