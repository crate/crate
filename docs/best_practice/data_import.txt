==================================
Importing huge datasets into Crate
==================================

When you start a project one does not usually start with nothing.
Most of the time there is pre-existing data that needs to be imported,
and sometimes the amount of data is significant.

Assume you have an existing application that generates a few hundred
thousand records a day and you are about to migrate to a new stack
with Crate as the database backend. You'll need a way to import the
existing millions of records into Crate as quickly as possible.

This best practice example will guide you through the process and shows
tips and tricks on how to import your data quickly and safe.


Defining the Data Structure
---------------------------

Before starting the import you'll have to consider how your data
structure will look. Decisions made at this point will influence
the import process later.

For this example we have a simple single ``user`` table with 6 columns
of different types.

By default you would probably create the table like this::

  cr> CREATE TABLE user (
  ...   id INT primary key,
  ...   name STRING,
  ...   day_joined TIMESTAMP,
  ...   bio STRING INDEX using fulltext,
  ...   address OBJECT (dynamic) AS (
  ...     city STRING,
  ...     country STRING
  ...   )
  ... );
  CREATE OK (... sec)

.. hide:

  cr> DROP TABLE user;
  DROP OK (... sec)

There's nothing wrong with this method and it does the job, but it is not very
performant and therefore not what we want to use in a real world
application.


Shards & Replicas
.................

If you do not set the number of shards and/or number of replicas,
the default configuration will be used, which is:

:shards:
  5
:replicas:
  1

The number of shards are not the biggest speed break,
but replicas are!

So we recommend you choose the number of shards wisely. They depend
on the amount of instances in the cluster as well as on the amount
of data that goes into the table.

.. note::

  Be careful, you cannot change the number of shards once the table
  is created!

Assuming there are 6 instances in the cluster we put 2 shards on each node
giving us a total of 12 shards, which should be more than enough
for millions of records.

Shards can be thought of as "virtual nodes" - create enough for your
needs for scaling, but use as few as possible to keep the
resource overhead (such as file descriptors and memory) as small
as possible.

More important is to set the number of replicas as low as possible,
ideally to zero. Whilst importing data, replication is usually
not necessary anyway. If the import fails, we can drop the table and
re-import again.

The ``CREATE TABLE`` statement now looks like::

  cr> CREATE TABLE user (
  ...   id INT primary key,
  ...   name STRING,
  ...   day_joined TIMESTAMP,
  ...   bio STRING INDEX using fulltext,
  ...   address OBJECT (dynamic) AS (
  ...     city STRING,
  ...     country STRING
  ...   )
  ... ) CLUSTERED INTO 12 shards
  ... WITH (number_of_replicas = 0);
  CREATE OK (... sec)

.. seealso::

  - :ref:`replication`


Refresh Interval
................

Another simple, but very important tweak to speed up importing is
to set the refresh interval of the table to 0.
This will disable the periodic refresh of the table that is needed
to minimise the effect of eventual consistency and therefore also
minimise the overhead during import.

::

  cr> ALTER TABLE user SET (refresh_interval = 0);
  ALTER OK (... sec)

.. hide:

  cr> DROP TABLE user;
  DROP OK (... sec)

It is possible to set the refresh interval
in the ``CREATE TABLE`` statement::

  cr> CREATE TABLE user (
  ...   id INT primary key,
  ...   name STRING,
  ...   day_joined TIMESTAMP,
  ...   bio STRING INDEX using fulltext,
  ...   address OBJECT (dynamic) AS (
  ...     city STRING,
  ...     country STRING
  ...   )
  ... ) CLUSTERED INTO 12 shards
  ... WITH (
  ...   number_of_replicas = 0,
  ...   refresh_interval = 0
  ... );
  CREATE OK (... sec)


Once the import is finished you can set the refresh interval to
a reasonable value (time in ms)::

  cr> ALTER TABLE user SET (refresh_interval = 1000);
  ALTER OK (... sec)

.. seealso::

  - :ref:`refresh_data`
  - :ref:`sql_ref_refresh_interval`

Store Level Throttling
.......................

If you do not need to query your data during import, which is the case
most of the time, you can lighten the merge throttling behaviour that
otherwise would ensure better search performance.

To improve indexing performance you can temporarily disable throttling
completely by setting the ``indices.store.throttle.type`` to ``none``.

::

  cr> SET GLOBAL TRANSIENT indices.store.throttle.type = 'none';
  SET OK (... sec)

However if you still want to throttle the merging of segments during import
you can increase the maximum bytes per second from its default of ``20mb``
to something like 100-200mb/s for SSD disks::

  cr> SET GLOBAL TRANSIENT indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec = '150mb';
  SET OK (... sec)


After import don't forget to turn throttling on again by setting its
value to ``merge`` (default) or ``all``.

::

  cr> SET GLOBAL TRANSIENT indices.store.throttle.type = 'merge';
  SET OK (... sec)

.. seealso::

  - :ref:`indices.store.throttle`

Importing Data Using COPY FROM
------------------------------

Once the table is created it is time for the actual import. Use the
``COPY FROM`` command to import data into a table efficiently. For more
in-depth documentation on ``COPY FROM`` see :ref:`copy_from`.

JSON Import Format
..................

Crate has native support for ``JSON`` formatted data, where each line is a
``JSON`` string and represents a single record.
The keys of the ``JSON`` objects are mapped to the columns when imported.

For example: ``users.json``

.. code-block:: json

   {"id": 1, "name": "foo", "day_joined": 1408312800, "bio": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.", "address": {"city": "Dornbirn", "country": "Austria"}}
   {"id": 2, "name": "bar", "day_joined": 1408312800, "bio": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.", "address": {"city": "Berlin", "country": "Germany"}}

COPY FROM Command
.................

::

  cr> COPY user FROM '/tmp/best_practice_data/users.json';
  COPY OK, 150 rows affected (... sec)

.. hide:

  cr> REFRESH TABLE user;
  REFRESH OK (... sec)

  cr> delete from user;
  DELETE OK, -1 rows affected (... sec)

.. note::

  When importing data using ``COPY FROM`` Crate does not check if the types
  from the columns and the types from the import file match. It does not cast
  the types to their target but will always import the data as it is
  in the source file.


Bulk Size
^^^^^^^^^

The bulk size defines the amount of lines that are read at once and imported
into the table. You can specify it in the ``WITH`` clause of the statement
and defaults to 10,000 if not specified.

For example::

  cr> COPY user FROM '/tmp/best_practice_data/users.json'
  ... WITH (bulk_size = 2000);
  COPY OK, 150 rows affected (... sec)

.. hide:

  cr> REFRESH TABLE user;
  REFRESH OK (... sec)

  cr> delete from user;
  DELETE OK, -1 rows affected (... sec)

In our example it will not make a difference, but if you have a more complex
data set with a lot of columns and large values, it probably makes sense to
decrease the ``bulk_size``. A ``bulk_size`` value that is too large might consume a lot of node resources while a small ``bulk_size`` can increase the overhead per request.


Compression
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not have your data locally to the nodes, but somewhere on the network,
e.g. ``NAS`` or ``S3``, it is recommended to use ``gzip`` compression to reduce
the network traffic needed to obtain the data.

Crate does not automatically detect compression, so you'll need to specify
``gzip`` compression in the ``WITH`` clause.

For example::

  cr> COPY user FROM '/tmp/best_practice_data/users.json.gz'
  ... WITH (compression = 'gzip');
  COPY OK, 150 rows affected (... sec)

.. hide:

  cr> REFRESH TABLE user;
  REFRESH OK (... sec)

Partitioned Tables
------------------

Sometimes you want to split your table into partitions
to be able to handle datasets (e.g. backup/restore) more efficiently.
To demonstrate data import into partitioned tables, we could in our case
make a partition for every day (not necessarily very useful).

Partitions can be created using the ``CREATE TABLE`` statement
using the ``PARTITIONED BY`` clause.

Because there is already a column with a primary key in our example,
either the partition column must also have a primary key,
or the other column must lose its constraint.

.. hide:

  cr> DROP TABLE user;
  DROP OK (... sec)

::

  cr> CREATE TABLE user (
  ...   id INT primary key,
  ...   name STRING,
  ...   day_joined TIMESTAMP primary key,
  ...   bio STRING INDEX using fulltext,
  ...   address OBJECT (dynamic) AS (
  ...     city STRING,
  ...     country STRING
  ...   )
  ... ) CLUSTERED INTO 6 shards
  ... PARTITIONED BY (day_joined)
  ... WITH (number_of_replicas = 0);
  CREATE OK (... sec)

To import data into partitioned tables efficiently you will have to import
each table partition separately. Since the value of the table partition is not
stored in the column of the table, the ``JSON`` source must not contain
the column value.

For example: ``users_1408312800.json``

.. code-block:: json

   {"id": 1, "name": "foo", "bio": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.", "address": {"city": "Dornbirn", "country": "Austria"}}
   {"id": 2, "name": "bar", "bio": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.", "address": {"city": "Berlin", "country": "Germany"}}

However the value of the partition column however defined in the ``COPY FROM`` statement using the ``PARTITION`` clause::

  cr> COPY user PARTITION (day_joined=1408312800)
  ... FROM '/tmp/best_practice_data/users_1408312800.json';
  COPY OK, 23 rows affected (... sec)

This way, Crate does not need to resolve the partition for each row that is imported but can store it directly into the correct place resulting in a much faster import.

However, it is still possible (but not recommended) to import into partitioned tables without the ``PARTITION`` clause and have the column value in the source.

Summary
-------

To sum up the points described above, importing huge data sets is not difficult
if a few things are kept in mind. These are:

- Reduce the number of replicas as much as possible, ideally to 0. Replication slows down the import process.
- Use only as many shards as you really need.
- Disable the periodic table refresh by setting the refresh interval to 0 during import.
- Adjust the bulk size of the import depending on the size of your records.
- Import table partitions separately using the ``PARTITION`` clause in the
  ``COPY TO`` statement.

And last but not least:

- Import speed significantly increases with increasing disk I/O. Using SSDs
  for Crate is recommended anyway, but having one disk more (by adding
  another node) in the cluster, can make quite a difference.
