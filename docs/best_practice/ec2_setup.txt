Crate Setup on Amazon EC2
=========================

When running Crate in a cloud environment such as `Amazon EC2`_ (Elastic Cloud
Compute) you usually face the problem that Crate's default discovery mechanism
does not work out of the box.

Luckily, Crate has several built-in mechanisms for unicast host discovery,
also one for EC2. EC2 discovery uses the `EC2 API`_ to look up other EC2 hosts
that are then used as unicast hosts for node discovery (see
:ref:`conf_discovery`).

.. note::

  Note that this best practice only describes how to use the EC2 discovery and
  its settings, and not how to set up a cluster on EC2 securely.


Basic Configuration
===================

The most important step for EC2 discovery is that you have the launch your EC2
instances within the same security group. The rules of that security group must
at least allow traffic on Crate's transport port (default ``4300``). This will
allow Crate to accept and respond to pings from other Crate instances with the
same cluster name and form a cluster.

Once you have your instances running and Crate installed, you can enable the
EC2 discovery by **simply setting the discovery type to "ec2"**::

  discovery.type: ec2

However, in order to be able to use the EC2 API, Crate must `sign the requests`_
using AWS credentials consisting of an access key and a secret key.

Authentication
--------------

For that it is recommended to create a separate user that has only the necessary
permissions to describe instances. These permissions are attached to the user
via a policy file that looks like:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Action": [
          "ec2:DescribeInstances"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": [
          "*"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
  }

The preferred way to provide these AWS credentials for Crate is as environment
variables::

  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
  export AWS_SECRET_KEY="..."

.. note::

  The same environment variables are used when performing ``COPY FROM`` and
  ``COPY TO``. This means that if you use want these statement you'll have
  to extend the permissions of that EC2 user.

You could also provide them as system properties or as settings in the
``crate.yml``, but the advantage of env variables is that also
``COPY FROM/TO`` statements use the same environment variables.

.. note::

  Note that the env variables need to be provided for the user that runs the
  Crate process, which is usually the user ``crate`` in production.

Now you are ready to start your Crate instances and they will discovery each
other automatically. Note that all Crate instances of the same region will join
the cluster as long as their cluster name is equal and they are able to "talk"
to each other over the transport port.


Production Setup
================

For a production setup the best way to filter instances for discovery is via
security group. This requires that you create a separate security group for
each cluster and allow TCP traffic on transport port ``4300`` (or other, if set
to a different port) only from within the group.

    :width: 100%

Since the instances that belong to the same Crate cluster have the same security
group then, you can easly filter instances by that group.

For example when you launch your instances with the security group
``sg-crate-demo``, your Crate setting would be::

  discovery.ec2.groups: sg-crate-demo

The combination with the unique cluster name makes the production setup very
simple yet secure.

See also :ref:`discovery.ec2.groups <discovery_ec2_groups>`.


Optional Filters
================

Sometimes however, you will want to have a more flexible setup. In this case
there are a few other settings that can be set.

Filter by Tags
--------------

The E2 discovery mechanism can additionaly filter machines by instance tags.
Tags are key-value pairs that can be assigned to an instance as meta data when
it is launched.

A good example usage of tags is to assign environment and usage type information.

Let's assume you have pool of several instances tagged with ``env`` and ``type``,
where ``env`` is either ``dev`` or ``production`` and ``type`` is either ``app``
or ``database``.

 .. image:: ../_static/ec2-discovery-tags.png
    :alt: Adding tags on instance launch
    :width: 100%

Setting ``discovery.ec2.tag.env`` to ``production`` will filter machines with
the tag key ``env`` set to ``production`` excluding machines that have set the
same key set to ``dev`` (and vice versa).
To further more exclude "``app`` instances" from discovery you can add the
setting ``discovery.ec2.tag.type: database``.

This way, any number of tags can be used for filtering, using the
``discovery.ec2.tag.`` prefix for the setting name.

Filtering by tags can help when you want to launch several Crate clusters within
the same security group, e.g::

  discovery.ec2:
      groups: sg-crate-demo
      tag.env: production
      tag.type: database

See also :ref:`discovery.ec2.tags <discovery_ec2_tags>`.

Filter by Availability Zones
----------------------------

A third possible way to filter instances is via availability zone. Let's say
you have several clusters for the same tenant in different availability zones
(e.g. ``us-west-1`` and ``us-west-2``), you can launch the instance with the same
security group (e.g. ``sg-crate-demo``) and filter the instances used for
discovery by availability zone::

  discovery.ec2:
      groups: sg-crate-demo
      availability_zones: us-west-1
