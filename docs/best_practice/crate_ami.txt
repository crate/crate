=============================================
Launching EC2 Instances with Crate AMI on AWS
=============================================

Crate provides custom AMIs (see `AMI`_) that can be launched from every
EC2 user by using the AWS Management Console or `AWS CLI`_. The naming
convention is as follows:

  ``Crate-AWS-AMI-<VERSION>-<REVISION>``

The placeholder ``<VERSION>`` is the Crate version in format x.y.z and
``<REVISION`` describes its build revision.

Find Crate AMI
==============

To launch an own EC2 instance based on the Crate AMI use the search panel to
to find the image on the public AMI repository. After choosing the desired AMI
by its Crate version it can be launched as an EC2 instance running on your
account.

If you are using the `AWS CLI`_ you can find the public Crate AMI by using the
``describe-images`` command. The easiest way to search for it is by its
``AMI Name``. AMIs are listed in JSON-format and sorted by their creation date.
The following command lists every available Crate AMI on the AWS platform.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=name,Values=Crate-AWS-AMI-*"


Launch the AMI
==============

You can launch one or more instances with the Crate AMI using the ``run-instances``
command utilizing the ``--image-id`` command line option. Use the
available parameters of the command to configure its start-up behavior and
hardware configuration.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <AMI-ID> --count <NR-OF-INSTANCES> --instance-type <INSTANCE-TYPE> --user-data <USER-DATA>


The AMI has Crate installed and configured so it uses ``EC2 discovery``
(see :ref:`ec2_setup`). It is required that you provide Crate with your AWS
credentials that it can authenticate requests on the EC2 API. You can provide
these credentials (access key and secret key) as part of the user data when
launching the instance.

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='<your_access_key_id>'
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='<your_secret_access_key>'
    " >> /etc/sysconfig/crate

This configuration script will be launched on startup of each instance.
The following example shows how you can run a single instance of type
``m3.medium`` and pass the AWS credentials as a file (provided as
``user-data.sh``).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-544c1923 --count 1 --instance-type m3.medium --user-data $(base64 user-data.sh)


.. note::
    In case that you want to filter machines by instance tags or security groups
    add this configuration also to the ``USER-DATA`` field parameter
    (see :ref:`filter-by-tags`).


Instance Types
==============

The instance type specifies the combination of CPU, memory, storage and
networking capacity. To receive a better performance for running queries
select an instance type which gives you the possibility to attach ephemeral
storage. On newer instance types on AWS this storage is covered by
`Solid-State-Drives`_ (short *SSD*). By choosing one of those instance types
Crate will automatically mount and store its data on those devices if they are
attached to the instance as a block device mapping (see also :ref:`attached_devices`).
Instance Types with additional instance store volumes (SSD or HDD) are
currently all instances of type ``m3``, ``g2``, ``r3``, ``d2`` and ``i2``.

.. _attached_devices:

Attached Devices
================

To add a block device mapping before launching an instance it is possible to
use the ``block-device-mappings`` parameter on the ``run-instances`` command.
In this case ``ephemeral1`` will be added as an instance store volume with the
device name ``/dev/sdc``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-544c1923 --count 1 --instance-type m3.medium --block-device-mappings "[{\"DeviceName\": \"/dev/sdc\",\"VirtualName\":\"ephemeral1\"}]"

.. note::
    Note that the data stored on ephemeral disks is nor permanent and only
    persists during the lifetime of an instance.

If no block device mapping is configured on the EC2 instance the default data
directory of Crate is set to ``/var/lib/crate``. The data paths are set in
``/etc/crate/crate.yml``.
