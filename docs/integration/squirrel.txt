=============================
Using Crate with SQuirreL SQL
=============================

SQuirreL_ is a graphical SQL client application that can be used to browse and
query a JDBC compliant database.

As Crate supports JDBC with its `Crate JDBC` driver, it can easily be used with
SQUirreL_.

Setup
=====

SQuirreL_ does not provide a Crate driver with its distribution, so an extra
setup step is required to run Crate with SQuirreL_:

 #. Copy the `Crate JDBC standalone jar`_ to the SQuirreL ``lib`` folder.
    On OS X, when installing SQuirreL_ with the MaxOS X installer, this is
    ``/Applications/SQuirreLSQL.app/Contents/Resources/Java/lib/``
 #. Start SQuirreL_.
 #. Choose the ``Drivers`` tab and add a new driver, adding the following
    information into the form and confirm by pressing ``ok``.

 #. Choose the ``Aliases`` tab and add a new Alias,
    Choose your new driver (called crate in our example) and enter your database
    URL. Username and password are not supported, so leave them blank.

 #. Connect your alias to your crate instance.

Usage
=====

You can browse Crate using the ``Object Tree Worksheet``, that is the usual view
you use for browsing your tables and get information about their schema.

When browsing a table's content using ``Content``, it is possible to edit
the table contents by right-clicking and choosing ``Make Editable``.

Using the SQuirreL_ SQL Editor it is possible to execute arbitrary SQL commands
and scripts.
