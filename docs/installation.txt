After downloading the latest stable version of Crate from
http://download.cratedb.org/ the package needs to be unpacked::

   sh$ tar zxf crate-0.8.5.tar.gz

Now Cate can be started in the foreground like this::

   sh$ ./bin/crate -f

In order to start in the background omit the `-f` option. If started
in the foreground you can use Control-C to stop the process again.

.. Note::

 Crate needs a working Java_ installation in order to run.
