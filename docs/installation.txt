Installation
============

.. _install_targz:

Install via tar.gz
==================

.. highlight:: sh

After downloading the latest stable version of Crate Data from
`https://crate.io/download/ <https://crate.io/download/>`_
the package needs to be unpacked::

   sh$ tar zxf crate-*.tar.gz

Crate can be started in the foreground like this::

   sh$ ./bin/crate

In order to start in the background add the ``-d`` option. If started in the
foreground you can use ``Control-C`` to stop the process again.


The CrateShell (Crash) is shipped with the tarball distribution.
You can start the shell using the ``crash`` command::

  sh$ ./bin/crash

The Crate distribution also comes with a web based administration
interface. It is served on port ``4200`` and you can access it with
your browser once Crate is started::

  http://host1.example.com:4200/admin/

.. note::

  Crate Data needs a working Java 7 virtual machine. We recommend
  using `Oracle's Java`_ on OSX and OpenJDK_ on Linux Systems.


.. _install_production:

Install Crate Data for Production
=================================

We provide distributions for **RHEL/YUM** based systems, **Ubuntu**
and **Arch Linux**.

You can find instruction how to install Crate Data for production on
the Download_ page.
