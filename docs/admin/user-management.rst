User management
===============

User account information is stored in the cluster metadata of CrateDB and
supports the following statements to create, alter and drop users:

    * `CREATE USER`_
    * `ALTER USER`_
    * `DROP USER`_

These statements are database management statements that can be invoked by
superusers that already exist in the CrateDB cluster. The `CREATE USER`_ and
`DROP USER`_ statements can also be invoked by users with the ``AL`` privilege.

When CrateDB is started, the cluster contains one predefined superuser. This
user is called ``crate``. It is not possible to create any other superusers

The definition of all users, including hashes of their passwords, is backed up
together with the cluster's metadata when a snapshot is created, and it is 
restored when using the ``ALL``, ``METADATA``, or ``USERS`` keywords with the 
:ref:`sql-restore-snapshot` command.

``CREATE USER``
===============

To create a new user for the CrateDB database cluster use the
:ref:`ref-create-user` SQL statement::

    cr> CREATE USER user_a;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

.. TIP::

    Newly created users do not have any privileges. After creating a user, you
    should :ref:`configure user privileges <administration-privileges>`.

    For example, to grant all privileges to the ``user_a`` user, run::

        cr> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO user_a;
        GRANT OK, 4 rows affected (... sec)

.. hide:

    cr> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES FROM user_a;
    REVOKE OK, 4 rows affected (... sec)

It can be used to connect to the database cluster using available authentication
methods. You can specify the user's password in the ``WITH`` clause of the
``CREATE`` statement. This is required if you want to use the
:ref:`auth_password`::

    cr> CREATE USER user_b WITH (password = 'a_secret_password');
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

The username parameter of the statement follows the principles of an identifier
which means that it must be double-quoted if it contains special characters
(e.g. whitespace) or if the case needs to be maintained::

    cr> CREATE USER "Custom User";
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

If a user with the username specified in the SQL statement already exists the
statement returns an error::

    cr> CREATE USER "Custom User";
    UserAlreadyExistsException[User 'Custom User' already exists]


``ALTER USER``
==============

To alter the password for an existing user from the CrateDB database cluster use
the :ref:`ref-alter-user` SQL statement::

    cr> ALTER USER user_a SET (password = 'pass');
    ALTER OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

The password can be reset (cleared) if specified as ``NULL``::

    cr> ALTER USER user_a SET (password = NULL);
    ALTER OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

.. NOTE::

    The built-in superuser ``crate`` has no password and it is not possible to set a new password for this user.


``DROP USER``
=============

.. hide:

    cr> CREATE USER user_c;
    CREATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

To remove an existing user from the CrateDB database cluster use the
:ref:`ref-drop-user` SQL statement::

    cr> DROP USER user_c;
    DROP OK, 1 row affected (... sec)

If a user with the username specified in the SQL statement does not exist the
statement returns an error::

    cr> DROP USER user_c;
    UserUnknownException[User 'user_c' does not exist]

.. NOTE::

    It is not possible to drop the built-in superuser ``crate``.

List users
==========

CrateDB exposes database users via the read-only ``sys.users`` system table.
The ``sys.users`` table shows all users in the cluster which can be used for
authentication. The initial superuser ``crate`` which is available for all
CrateDB clusters is also part of that list.

To list all existing users query that table::

    cr> SELECT * FROM sys.users order by name;
    +-------------+----------+-----------+
    | name        | password | superuser |
    +-------------+----------+-----------+
    | Custom User |     NULL | FALSE     |
    | crate       |     NULL | TRUE      |
    | user_a      |     NULL | FALSE     |
    | user_b      | ******** | FALSE     |
    +-------------+----------+-----------+
    SELECT 4 rows in set (... sec)

The column ``name`` shows the unique name of the user, the column ``superuser``
shows whether the user has superuser privileges or not.

.. NOTE::

    CrateDB also supports retrieving the current connected user using the
    :ref:`system information functions <scalar-sysinfo>`: :ref:`CURRENT_USER
    <scalar-current_user>`, :ref:`USER <scalar-user>` and :ref:`SESSION_USER
    <scalar-session_user>`.
