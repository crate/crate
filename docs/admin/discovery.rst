Amazon EC2 discovery
====================

CrateDB has native discovery support when running a cluster with *Amazon Web
Services* (AWS). The discovery mechanism uses the `Amazon EC2`_ API to
generate the list of hosts for the unicast host discovery (see
:ref:`conf_host_discovery`).

There is a `best practice`_ how to configure and run a CrateDB
cluster on Amazon EC2.
