Contributing to Crate
=====================

Thanks for considering contributing to crate.


Reporting an issue
------------------

- Search existing issues before raising a new one.

- include as much details as possible. This might include:

  - Which OS you're using.

  - Which version you've been running.

  - Logs/Stacktrace of the error that occurred.

  - Steps to reproduce.


Pull requests
-------------

Before we can accept any pull requests to Crate Data we need you to agree to
our CLA_. Once that is done, we suggest to continue as follows:

 - Add an issue on Github and let us know that you're working on something.

 - Use a feature branch, not master.

 - Rebase your feature branch onto origin/master before raising the PR

 - Be descriptive in your PR and commit messages. What is it for, why is it
   needed, etc.

 - Make sure the tests pass. (`./gradlew test itest`)

 - Squash related commits
