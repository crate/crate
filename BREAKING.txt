========================================
 BREAKING CHANGES due to ES 5.x upgrade
========================================

- some translog settings are gone, see:
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking_50_settings_changes.html#_translog_settings
  additionally `disable_flush` is also gone

- `es.insecure.allow.root` setting is gone, it's no longer possible to run crate as root
  (but we could re-allow this easily if we really want to)

- Plugin interface changed (mostly related to gone index/shard injection),
  AbstractPlugin is removed (not needed anymore due to java8), documentation needs to be updated
