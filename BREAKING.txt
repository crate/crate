========================================
 BREAKING CHANGES due to ES 5.x upgrade
========================================

- some translog settings are gone, see:
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking_50_settings_changes.html#_translog_settings
  additionally `disable_flush` is also gone

- `es.insecure.allow.root` setting is gone, it's no longer possible to run crate as root
  (but we could re-allow this easily if we really want to)

- Plugin interface changed (mostly related to gone index/shard injection),
  AbstractPlugin is removed (not needed anymore due to java8), documentation needs to be updated

- Logging is no configured by `log4j2.properties` instead of `logging.yml`

- `thrift` transport is no longer supported and so the `thrift.*` settings

- recovery settings changed, see:
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking_50_settings_changes.html#_recovery_settings

- some shard balance settings are gone: `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.primary` and `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.replica`
  these removals are undocumented at ES, and they are still used inside some unit tests of ES without effect

- following `indices.recovery` settings are gone (also the ES 5.0 breaking changes tell different):
    - `indices.recovery.file_chunk_size`
    - `indices.recovery.translog_ops`
    - `indices.recovery.translog_size`
    - `indices.recovery.compress`

- setting `indices.recovery.activity_timeout` renamed to `indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout`

- `path.work` setting is gone, was not used at 2.x anyway, relict of < ES 1.0, remove it from documentation

- in general, settings cannot be set via system properties anymore.
  only possible for:
    - `es.path.conf`
    - `es.path.data`
    - `es.path.home`
    - `es.path.logs`
