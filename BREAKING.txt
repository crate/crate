========================================
 BREAKING CHANGES due to ES 5.x upgrade
========================================

- Tables created with Crate versions older than 0.46.0 will have to be 
  recreated. This is due to the way numeric docvalues are stored starting with  
  Crate 0.46.0 (sorted numeric instead of binary) which uses ES 1.4 
  The backwards compatibility layer for binary docvalues was removed in ES 5.x

- -Des cannot be used anymore, ES 5.0 needs -Eparam=value which is passed as command line argument
  after the main class.

- Queries on columns with ``INDEX OFF`` will now fail instead of always
  resulting in an empty result.

- Discovery using `Multicast` is removed. `Unicast` is the default discovery mechanism.

- `COPY FROM` now requires column names to be quoted in the JSON file being imported.

- some translog settings are gone, see:
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking_50_settings_changes.html#_translog_settings
  additionally `disable_flush` is also gone

- `es.insecure.allow.root` setting is gone, it's no longer possible to run crate as root
  (but we could re-allow this easily if we really want to)

- Plugin interface changed (mostly related to gone index/shard injection),
  AbstractPlugin is removed (not needed anymore due to java8), documentation needs to be updated

- Logging is now configured by `log4j2.properties` instead of `logging.yml`

- `thrift` transport is no longer supported and so the `thrift.*` settings

- recovery settings changed, see:
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking_50_settings_changes.html#_recovery_settings

- some shard balance settings are gone: `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.primary` and `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.replica`
  these removals are undocumented at ES, and they are still used inside some unit tests of ES without effect

- following `indices.recovery` settings are gone (also the ES 5.0 breaking changes tell different):
    - `indices.recovery.file_chunk_size`
    - `indices.recovery.translog_ops`
    - `indices.recovery.translog_size`
    - `indices.recovery.compress`

- setting `indices.recovery.activity_timeout` renamed to `indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout`

- `path.work` setting is gone, was not used at 2.x anyway, relict of < ES 1.0, remove it from documentation

- in general, settings cannot be set via system properties anymore.
  only possible for:
    - `es.path.conf`
    - `es.path.data`
    - `es.path.home`
    - `es.path.logs`

- built-in analyzer has changed (documentation requires update):
    - removed `classic`
    - added `fingerprint`

- built-in token-filters has changed (documentations requires update):
    - added `fingerprint`, `keep_types`, `min_hash`, `serbian_normalization`
    - removed `keyword_repeat`, `type_as_payload`
