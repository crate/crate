# Crate uses log4j as internal logging abstraction.
# Configure log4j as you need it to behave by setting the log4j prefixes in
# this file.

# Specify the log level and its appender for each logger as follows.
# The appenders can be configured further down below.
rootLogger: INFO, console, file

logger:
#  Log action execution errors for easier debugging
  action: DEBUG

#  Peer shard recovery
# indices.recovery: DEBUG

#  Discovery
#  Crate will discover the other nodes within its own cluster.
#  If you want to log the discovery process, set the following:
# discovery: TRACE

# mute amazon s3 client logging a bit
  com.amazonaws: WARN

# Define your appenders here.
# Like mentioned above, use the log4j prefixes to configure for example the
# type or layout.
# For all available settings, take a look at the log4j documentation.
