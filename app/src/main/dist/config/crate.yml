######################### Crate Configuration Example #########################

# The default configuration offers the ability to use Crate right away.
# The purpose of this file is to give operators an overview of the various
# different configuration settings. To read the full documentation go to
# <https://docs.crate.io/>

# As mentioned before, you can use Crate right away. For fine-tuning consider
# to configure Crate as you need or want it to behave.
# Use this file to fine-tune your Crate cluster. If you have any questions
# you are very welcome to conact us on our IRC channel #crate
# (irc.freenode.net).

# Any element in the configuration can be replaced with environment variables
# by placing them in ${...} notation. For example:
#
# node.rack: ${RACK_ENV_VAR}


################################### Cluster ###################################

# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running
# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names.
#
# cluster.name: crate


#################################### Node #####################################

# Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved
# from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name:
#
# node.name: "Franz Kafka"

# Every node can be configured to allow or deny being eligible as the master,
# and to allow or deny to store the data.
#
# Allow this node to be eligible as a master node (enabled by default):
#
# node.master: true
#
# Allow this node to store data (enabled by default):
#
# node.data: true

# You can exploit these settings to design advanced cluster topologies.
#
# 1. You want this node to never become a master node, only to hold data.
#    This will be the "workhorse" of your cluster.
#
# node.master: false
# node.data: true
#
# 2. You want this node to only serve as a master: to not store any data and
#    to have free resources. This will be the "coordinator" of your cluster.
#
# node.master: true
# node.data: false
#
# 3. You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but
#    to act as a "search load balancer" (fetching data from nodes,
#    aggregating results, etc.)
#
# node.master: false
# node.data: false

# Inspect the cluster state via the Cluster Health API
# [http://localhost:4200/_cluster/health/], the
# Node Info API [http://localhost:4200/_cluster/nodes/] or GUI tools
# such as Crate Admin [http://localhost:4200/admin/],
# elasticsearch-head [http://localhost:4200/_plugin/head/],
# bigdesk [http://localhost:4200/_plugin/bigdesk/] and
# segmentspy [http://localhost:4200/_plugin/segmentspy/].

# A node can have generic attributes associated with it, which can later be
# used for customized shard allocation filtering, or allocation awareness.
# An attribute is a simple key value pair, similar to node.key: value, here is
# an example:
#
# node.rack: rack314

# By default, multiple nodes are allowed to start from the same installation
# location to disable it, set the following:
# node.max_local_storage_nodes: 1


#################################### Table ####################################

# You can set a number of options (such as shard/replica options, mapping
# or analyzer definitions, translog settings, ...) for tables globally,
# in this file.
#
# Note, that it makes more sense to configure table settings specifically for
# a certain table when creating it.

# Set the number of shards (splits) of a table (5 by default):
#
# index.number_of_shards: 5

# Set the number of replicas (additional copies) of a table (1 by default):
#
# index.number_of_replicas: 1

# Note, that for development on a local machine, with small tables, it usually
# makes sense to "disable" the distributed features:
#
# index.number_of_shards: 1
# index.number_of_replicas: 0

# These settings directly affect the performance of table and search operations
# in your cluster. Assuming you have enough machines to hold shards and
# replicas, the rule of thumb is:
#
# 1. Having more *shards* enhances the _indexing_ performance and allows to
#    _distribute_ a big table across machines.
# 2. Having more *replicas* enhances the _search_ performance and improves the
#    cluster _availability_.
#
# The "number_of_shards" is a one-time setting for a table.
#
# Crate takes care about load balancing, relocating, gathering the
# results from nodes, etc. Experiment with different settings to fine-tune
# your setup.

# Use the Table Status API (<http://localhost:4200/A/_status>) to inspect
# the table status.

# Enable/disable to delete all tables (Delete on root):
# action.disable_delete_all_indices: true


#################################### Paths ####################################

# Path to directory containing configuration (this file and logging.yml):
#
# path.conf: /path/to/conf

# Path to directory where to store table data allocated for this node.
#
# path.data: /path/to/data
#
# Can optionally include more than one location, causing data to be striped across
# the locations (a la RAID 0) on a file level, favouring locations with most free
# space on creation. For example:
#
# path.data: /path/to/data1,/path/to/data2

# Path to temporary files:
#
# path.work: /path/to/work

# Path to log files:
#
# path.logs: /path/to/logs

# Path to where plugins are installed:
#
# path.plugins: /path/to/plugins

# path:
#     logs: /var/log/crate
#     data: /var/lib/crate

#################################### Plugin ###################################

# If a plugin listed here is not installed for current node, the node will not start.
#
# plugin.mandatory: mapper-attachments,lang-groovy


################################### Memory ####################################

# Crate performs poorly when JVM starts swapping: you should ensure that
# it _never_ swaps.
#
# Set this property to true to lock the memory:
#
# bootstrap.mlockall: true

# Make sure that the CRATE_MIN_MEM and CRATE_MAX_MEM environment variables are
# set to the same value, and that the machine has enough memory to allocate
# for Crate, leaving enough memory for the operating system itself.
#
# You should also make sure that the Crate process is allowed to lock
# the memory, eg. by using `ulimit -l unlimited`.


############################## Network And HTTP ###############################

# Crate, by default, binds itself to the 0.0.0.0 address, and listens
# on port [4200-4300] for HTTP traffic and on port [4300-4400] for node-to-node
# communication. (the range means that if the port is busy, it will automatically
# try the next port).

# Set the bind address specifically (IPv4 or IPv6):
#
# network.bind_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set the address other nodes will use to communicate with this node. If not
# set, it is automatically derived. It must point to an actual IP address.
#
# network.publish_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set both 'bind_host' and 'publish_host':
#
# network.host: 192.168.0.1

# Set a custom port for the node to node communication (4300 by default):
#
# transport.tcp.port: 4300

# Enable compression for all communication between nodes (disabled by default):
#
# transport.tcp.compress: true

# Set a custom port to listen for HTTP traffic:
#
# http.port: 4200

# Set a custom allowed content length:
#
# http.max_content_length: 100mb

# Disable HTTP completely:
#
# http.enabled: false


################################### Gateway ###################################

# The gateway allows for persisting the cluster state between full cluster
# restarts. Every change to the state (such as adding a table) will be stored
# in the gateway, and when the cluster starts up for the first time,
# it will read its state from the gateway.

# There are several types of gateway implementations.

# The default gateway type is the "local" gateway (recommended):
#
# gateway.type: local

# Settings below control how and when to start the initial recovery process on
# a full cluster restart (to reuse as much local data as possible when
# using shared gateway).

# Allow recovery process after N nodes in a cluster are up:
#
# gateway.recover_after_nodes: 1

# Set the timeout to initiate the recovery process, once the N nodes
# from previous setting are up (accepts time value):
#
# gateway.recover_after_time: 5m

# Set how many nodes are expected in this cluster. Once these N nodes
# are up (and recover_after_nodes is met), begin recovery process immediately
# (without waiting for recover_after_time to expire):
#
# gateway.expected_nodes: 2


############################# Recovery Throttling #############################

# These settings allow to control the process of shards allocation between
# nodes during initial recovery, replica allocation, rebalancing,
# or when adding and removing nodes.

# Set the number of concurrent recoveries happening on a node:
#
# 1. During the initial recovery
#
# cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries: 4
#
# 2. During adding/removing nodes, rebalancing, etc
#
# cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries: 2

# Set to throttle throughput when recovering (eg. 100mb, by default unlimited):
#
# indices.recovery.max_size_per_sec: 20mb

# Set to limit the number of open concurrent streams when
# recovering a shard from a peer:
#
# indices.recovery.concurrent_streams: 5


################################## Discovery ##################################

# Discovery infrastructure ensures nodes can be found within a cluster
# and master node is elected. Multicast discovery is the default.

# Set to ensure a node sees N other master eligible nodes to be considered
# operational within the cluster. Its recommended to set it to a higher value
# than 1 when running more than 2 nodes in the cluster.
#
# discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 1

# Set the time to wait for ping responses from other nodes when discovering.
# Set this option to a higher value on a slow or congested network
# to minimize discovery failures:
#
# discovery.zen.ping.timeout: 3s

# Unicast discovery allows to explicitly control which nodes will be used
# to discover the cluster. It can be used when multicast is not present,
# or to restrict the cluster communication-wise.
#
# 1. Disable multicast discovery (enabled by default):
#
# discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
#
# 2. Configure an initial list of master nodes in the cluster
#    to perform discovery when new nodes (master or data) are started:
#
# discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["host1", "host2:port"]
