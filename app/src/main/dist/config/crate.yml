######################## CrateDB Configuration File ##########################

# The default configuration offers the ability to use CrateDB right away.
# The purpose of this file is to give operators an overview of the various
# different configuration settings. To read the full documentation go to
# <https://crate.io/docs/>

# Use this file to fine-tune your CrateDB cluster. If you have any questions
# you are welcome to contact us on Github
# <https://github.com/crate/crate/discussions>.


################################ Quick Settings ##############################

# Recommended memory settings:
# - set the environment variable CRATE_HEAP_SIZE to 25% of your memory
#   (e.g. 16G, but not more than ~30G to benefit from CompressedOops).
#   Depending on the OS update '/etc/default/crate' or '/etc/sysconfig/crate'
#
#   See https://crate.io/docs/crate/howtos/en/latest/performance/memory.html
#   for more details.
#
# - disable swapping
#bootstrap.memory_lock : true

# Storage: CrateDB can utilize multiple volumes in parallel, make sure to set
# the owner to 'crate:crate'
#path.data: /path/to/data1,/path/to/data2

# Clustering: The settings below offer a way to delay recovery until a number
# of data nodes are available, one reason to do this is to avoid the
# unnecesary creation of new replicas.
# The specified number of expected data nodes will also be used to give you a
# health check warning when the actual number of data nodes does not match the
# expected number.
#gateway.expected_data_nodes: 5
#gateway.recover_after_data_nodes: 3

# Networking: Bind to an IP address or interface other than localhost.
# Be careful! Never expose an unprotected node to the internet.
# Choose from [IP Address], _local_, _site_, _global_ or _[networkInterface]_
#network.host: _site_

# Cluster discovery: Specify the hosts which will form the CrateDB cluster
#discovery.seed_hosts:
#    - host1
#    - host2

# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes. All
# master-eligible nodes must be set here for clusters upgraded from CrateDB <
# 4.x which are non loop-back bound, otherwise the cluster is not able to
# initially vote an initial master node:
#
#cluster.initial_master_nodes:
#    - host1
#    - host2


################################# Full Settings ##############################

# The quick settings above should be sufficient for most situations.
# However, below are listed all available configuration options.

# Any element in the configuration can be replaced with environment variables
# by placing them in ${...} notation. For example:
#
#node.attr.rack: ${RACK_ENV_VAR}


#/////////////////////////// JMX Monitoring Plugin ///////////////////////////

# Enables the `sys.jobs`, `sys.operations`, `sys.jobs_log` and
# `sys.operations_log` tables
#stats.enabled: true

#//////////////////////// Database Administration ////////////////////////////

# To allow authenticated access to CrateDB from specific hosts, you must
# enable the host based authentication setting.
# The default value is `false`.
auth.host_based.enabled: true

# Client access and authentication is then configured via the host based
# config, a map of remote client access entries.
# The following example is a sane configuration that covers a common use case:
# * The predefined superuser `crate` has trusted access from localhost.
# * All other users require username/password authentication from anywhere.
#   Note that this authentication method is only available via Postgres
#   Protocol, meaning that with this configuration, connecting from non-local
#   hosts via HTTP would not be possible!
auth:
  host_based:
    config:
      0:
        user: crate
        address: _local_
        method: trust
      99:
        method: password

# When trust based authentication is used, the server just takes the username
# provided by the client as is without further validation. The HTTP
# implementation extracts the username from the standard HTTP Basic Authentication
# (`Authorization: Basic ...`) request header. In case the `Authorization` header is not set,
# a default username can be specified as follows:
#auth:
#  trust:
#    http_default_user: dustin

#///////////////////////// User Defined Functions ////////////////////////////

# To disable Javascript language for user defined functions, you can set it as
# follows. Default is enabled:
#lang.js.enabled: false

#/////////////////////////////////  SSL //////////////////////////////////////

# Enable encrypted communication for the HTTP endpoints:
#ssl.http.enabled: true

# Enable encrypted communication for the PostgreSQL wire protocol:
#ssl.psql.enabled: true

# The full path to the node keystore file
#ssl.keystore_filepath: /path/to/keystore_file.jks

# The password used to decrypt the keystore_file.jks
#ssl.keystore_password: myKeyStorePasswd

# The password entered at the end of the keytool -genkey command if different
# than the keystore_password.
#ssl.keystore_key_password: myKeyStorePasswd

# Optional configuration for truststore

# The full path to the node truststore file
#ssl.truststore_filepath: /path/to/truststore_file.jks

# The password used to decrypt the truststore_file.jks
#ssl.truststore_password: myTrustStorePasswd

# The frequency at which SSL files are monitored for changes
#ssl.resource_poll_interval: 5s

################################### Cluster ##################################

# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running
# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names.
#cluster.name: crate

# The graceful_stop namespace defines settings for a graceful stop
# procedure of nodes within the cluster.
#
# The minimum data availability the cluster needs to ensure when a certain
# node is shut down. By default the cluster ensures availability of primary
# shards but not replicas. Other options are "full" and "none".
#cluster.graceful_stop.min_availability: primaries
#
# The time to wait for the reallocation process to be finished.
#cluster.graceful_stop.timeout: 2h
#
# The force setting allows you to force a shutdown of a node when the graceful
# shutdown process runs into the cluster.graceful_stop.timeout.
#cluster.graceful_stop.force: false
#
# In most cases you want to allow all kinds of shards allocations.
#cluster.routing.allocation.enable = all
#
# However, you can limit shard allocations to certain kinds of shards,
# for example if you perform a rolling cluster upgrade.
#cluster.routing.allocation.enable = new_primaries

#################################### Node ####################################

# Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved
# from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name:
#node.name: "Piz Buin"

# Every node can be configured to allow or deny being eligible as the master,
# and to allow or deny to store the data.
#
# Allow this node to be eligible as a master node (enabled by default):
#node.master: true
#
# Allow this node to store data (enabled by default):
#node.data: true

# You can exploit these settings to design advanced cluster topologies.
#
# 1. You want this node to never become a master node, only to hold data.
#    This will be the "workhorse" of your cluster.
#node.master: false
#node.data: true
#
# 2. You want this node to only serve as a master: to not store any data and
#    to have free resources. This will be the "coordinator" of your cluster.
#node.master: true
#node.data: false
#
# 3. You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but
#    to act as a "search load balancer" (fetching data from nodes,
#    aggregating results, etc.)
#node.master: false
#node.data: false

# Inspect the cluster state via GUI tools
# such as CrateDB Admin [http://localhost:4200/admin/].

# A node can have generic attributes associated with it, which can later be
# used for customized shard allocation filtering, or allocation awareness.
# An attribute is a simple key value pair, similar to node.attr.key: value,
# here is an example:
#node.attr.rack: rack314

# The setting indicates whether or not memory-mapping is allowed.
# The default value is `true`.
#node.store.allow_mmap: true

#################################### Paths ###################################

# Relative paths are relative to CRATE_HOME. Absolute paths override this
# behavior.


# Path to directory containing configuration (this file and
# log4j2.properties):
#path.conf: config

# Path to directory where to store table data allocated for this node.
#path.data: data
#
# Can optionally include more than one location, causing data to be striped
# across the locations (a la RAID 0) on a file level, favouring locations with
# most free space on creation. For example:
#path.data: /path/to/data1,/path/to/data2

# Path to log files:
#path.logs: logs

# Alternative syntax for configuring path settings
#path:
#  logs: /var/log/crate
#  data: /var/lib/crate

# Path to directory where to store blob data allocated for this node.
#blobs.path: blobs

# See also: path.repo (further down)

################################### Memory ###################################

# CrateDB performs poorly when JVM starts swapping: you should ensure that
# it _never_ swaps.
#
# Set this property to true to lock the memory:
#bootstrap.memory_lock: true

# Make sure that the machine has enough memory to allocate for CrateDB,
# leaving enough memory for the operating system itself.
# You can allocate memory for CrateDB as follows:
#  - Set CRATE_MIN_MEM and CRATE_MAX_MEM environment variables
#    (We recommend to set MIN and MAX to the same value).
#  - Set CRATE_HEAP_SIZE environment varaible. This sets MIN and MAX to the
#    same value for you.
#
# You should also make sure that the CrateDB process is allowed to lock
# the memory, eg. by using `ulimit -l unlimited`.


############################## Network And HTTP ###############################

# CrateDB, by default, binds itself to the loopback addresses on the system,
# and listens on port [4200-4300] for HTTP traffic and on port [4300-4400] for
# node-to-node communication. (the range means that if the port is busy, it
# will automatically try the next port).
# Apart from IPv4 and IPv6 addresses there are some special values that can be
# used:
# _local_ Any loopback addresses on the system, for example 127.0.0.1.
# _site_ Any site-local addresses on the system, for example 192.168.0.1.
# _global_ Any globally-scoped addresses on the system, for example 8.8.8.8.
# _[networkInterface]_  Addresses of a network interface, for example _en0_.

# Set the bind address specifically (IPv4, IPv6 or special value):
#network.bind_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set the address other nodes will use to communicate with this node. If not
# set, it is automatically derived. It must point to an actual IP address.
#network.publish_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set both 'bind_host' and 'publish_host':
#network.host: 192.168.0.1

# Set a custom port for the node to node communication (4300 by default):
#transport.tcp.port: 4300

# Enable compression for all communication between nodes (disabled by
# default):
#transport.tcp.compress: true

# Set a custom port to listen for HTTP traffic:
#http.port: 4200

# Set a custom allowed content length:
#http.max_content_length: 100mb

################################### Gateway ##################################

# The gateway persists cluster meta data on disk every time the meta data
# changes. This data is stored persistently across full cluster restarts
# and recovered after nodes are started again.

# Defines the number of data nodes that need to be started before any cluster
# state recovery will start.
#gateway.recover_after_data_nodes: 2

# Defines the time to wait before starting the recovery once the number
# of nodes defined in gateway.recover_after_nodes are started.
#gateway.recover_after_time: 5m

# Defines how many data nodes should be waited for until the cluster state is
# recovered immediately. The value should be equal to the number of nodes
# in the cluster.
#gateway.expected_data_nodes: 3


############################ Recovery Throttling #############################

# These settings allow to control the process of shards allocation between
# nodes during initial recovery, replica allocation, rebalancing, or when
# adding and removing nodes.

# Set the number of concurrent recoveries happening on a node:
#
# 1. During the initial recovery
#cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries: 4
#
# 2. During adding/removing nodes, rebalancing, etc
#cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries: 2

# Specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be transferred during shard
# recovery per seconds. (by default 40mb):
#indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec: 40mb

# Specifies the time to wait after an issue caused by cluster state syncing
# before retrying to recover.
#indices.recovery.retry_delay_state_sync: 500ms

# Specifies the time to wait after an issue caused by the network before
# retrying to recover.
#indices.recovery.retry_delay_network: 5s

# Specifies the interval after which idle recoveries will be failed.
#indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout: 15m

# Specifies the timeout for internal requests made as part of the recovery.
#indices.recovery.internal_action_timeout: 15m

# Specifies the timeout for internal requests made as part of the recovery
# that are expected to take a long time.
#indices.recovery.internal_long_action_timeout: 30m

# Controls the number of file chunk requests that can be sent
# in parallel per recovery.
# indices.recovery.max_concurrent_file_chunks: 2


################################# Discovery ##################################

# Discovery infrastructure ensures nodes can be found within a cluster
# and a master node is elected. Unicast discovery is the default.
#
# Unicast discovery allows to explicitly control which nodes will be used
# to discover the cluster by pinging them.
#discovery.seed_hosts:
#  - host1:port
#  - host2:port
#
# If you want to debug the discovery process, you can set a logger in
# 'config/log4j2.properties' to help you doing so.

# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes. All
# master-eligible nodes must be set here for clusters upgraded from CrateDB <
# 4.x which are non loop-back bound, otherwise the cluster is not able to
# initially vote an initial master node:
#
#cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["host1", "host2"]

#/////////////////////////// Discovery via DNS ///////////////////////////////

# Service discovery allows CrateDB to look up hosts for unicast discovery via
# SRV DNS records.

# To enable SRV discovery you need to set the discovery type to 'srv'.
#discovery.seed_providers: srv

# Service discovery requires a query that is used to look up SRV records,
# this is usually in the format _service._protocol.fqdn
#discovery.srv.query: _crate._srv.example.com

#////////////////////////////// EC2 Discovery ////////////////////////////////

# EC2 discovery allows CrateDB to look up hosts for unicast discovery via the
# AWS EC2 API.

# To enable EC2 discovery you need to set the discovery type to 'ec2'.
#discovery.seed_providers: ec2

# There are multiple ways to filter EC2 instances:
#
# Filter by security groups, either by id or name. Only instances with the
# given group will be used for unicast host discovery.
#discovery.ec2.groups: sg-example-1, sg-example-2
#
# Control whether all (`false`) or just any (`true`) security group must
# be present for the instance to be used for discovery.
#discovery.ec2.any_group: true
#
# Filter by availability zones. Only instances within the given availability
# zone will be used for unicast host discovery.
#discovery.ec2.availability_zones:
#  - us-east-1
#  - us-west-1
#  - us-west-2
#  - ap-southeast-1
#  - ap-southeast-2
#  - ap-northeast-1
#  - eu-west-1
#  - eu-central-1
#  - sa-east-1
#  - cn-north-1
#
# EC2 instances for discovery can also be filtered by tags using the
# `discovery.ec2.tag.` prefix plus the tag name.
# E.g. to filter instances that have the `environment` tags with the value
# `dev` your setting will look like:
#discovery.ec2.tag.environment: dev
#discovery.ec2.tag.<name>: <value>
#
# If you have your own compatible implementation of the EC2 API service you
# can set the enpoint that should be used.
#discovery.ec2.endpoind: http://example.com/endpoint

#/////////////////////////////// Azure Discovery /////////////////////////////

# Azure discovery allows CrateDB to look up hosts for unicast discovery via
# the Azure API.

# To enable Azure discovery you need to set the discovery type to 'azure'.
#discovery.seed_providers: azure

# You should provide resource group name of your instances
#cloud.azure.management.resourcegroup.name: myrg

# The following configuration values must be provided for active directory
# authentication.
#cloud.azure.management.subscription.id: xxxxx.xxxx.xxx.xxx
#cloud.azure.management.tenant.id: xxxxxxxxxxx
#cloud.azure.management.app.id: xxxxxxxxxx
#cloud.azure.management.app.secret: my_password

# There are two methods of discovery. Discovery method ``vnet`` will discover
# all VMs in the same virtual network.
# The use of method ``subnet`` will add all virtual machines in the same
# subnet to the cluster.
#discovery.azure.method: vnet


############################# Routing Allocation #############################

# Allows to control shard allocation.
# Options are: `all | new_primaries`
#
# - `all` allows all shard allocations, the cluster can allocate all kinds of
#   shards.
# - `new_primaries` allows allocations for new primary shards only. This means
#   that for example a newly added node will not allocate any replicas.
#   However it is still possible to allocate new primary shards for new
#   indices. Whenever you want to perform a zero downtime upgrade of your
#   cluster you need to set this value before gracefully stopping the first
#   node and reset it to `all` after starting the last updated node.
#cluster.routing.allocation.enable: all

# Allow to control when rebalancing will happen based on the total state of
# all the indices shards in the cluster. Defaulting to `indices_all_active`
# to reduce chatter during initial recovery.
# Options are: `always | indices_primary_active | indices_all_active`
#cluster.routing.allocation.allow_rebalance: indices_all_active

# Define how many concurrent rebalancing tasks are allowed cluster wide.
#cluster.routing.allocation.cluster_concurrent_rebalance: 2

# Define the number of initial recoveries of primaries that are allowed per
# node. Since most times local gateway is used, those should be fast and we
# can handle more of those per node without creating load.
#cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries: 4

# How many concurrent recoveries are allowed to happen on a node.
#cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries: 2


################################## Awareness #################################

# Cluster allocation awareness allows to configure shard and replicas
# allocation across generic attributes associated with nodes.

# Define node attributes which will be used to do awareness based on the
# allocation of a shard and its replicas. Shards will relocate to even the
# number of shards across the nodes, but a shard and its replica will not be
# allocated in the same `rack_id` value.
#
# The awareness attributes can hold several values
#cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes:

# Node attributes on which shard allocation will be forced.
# If you know in advance the number of values an awareness attribute
# can have and you would like to never have more replicas then needed
# allocated on a specific group of nodes with the same awareness attribute
# value. For that, we can force awareness on specific attributes.
#cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.<attribute>.values:


############################### Balanced Shards ##############################

# Defines the weight factor for shards allocated on a node (float).
#cluster.routing.allocation.balance.shard: 0.45f

## Note that cluster.routing.allocation.balance.shard & cluster.routing.allocation.balance.index
## cannot be both set to 0.0f


# Defines a weight factor for the number of primaries of a specific index
# allocated on a node (float).
#cluster.routing.allocation.balance.primary: 0.05f

# Minimal optimization value of operations that should be performed (non
# negative float).
#cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold: 1.0f


####################### Cluster-Wide Allocation Filtering ####################

# Place new shards only on nodes where one of the specified values matches the
# attribute.
#cluster.routing.allocation.include.<attribute>:

# Place new shards only on nodes where none of the specified values matches
# the attribute.
#cluster.routing.allocation.exclude.<attribute>:

# used to specify a number of rules, which all MUST match for a node in order
# to allocate a shard on it.
# This is in contrast to include which will include a node if ANY rule
# matches.
#cluster.routing.allocation.require.<attribute>:


########################## Disk-based Shard Allocation #######################

# Prevent shard allocation on nodes depending on the disk usage.
#cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled: true

# Defines the lower disk threshold limit for shard allocations.
# New shards will not be allocated on nodes with disk usage greater than this
# value. It can also be set to an absolute bytes value (like e.g. `500mb`)
#cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low: 85%

# Defines the higher disk threshold limit for shard allocations.
# The cluster will attempt to relocate existing shards to another node if the
# disk usage on a node rises above this value. It can also be set to an
# absolute bytes value (like e.g. `500mb`)
#cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high: 90%

# Defines the threshold on which CrateDB enforces a read-only block on every
# index that has at least one shard allocated on a node with at least one disk
# exceeding the flood stage.
#cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage: 95%


########################## Field Data Circuit Breaker #########################

# for loading field data into memory.

# Specifies the limit for the fielddata breaker.
#indices.fielddata.breaker.limit: 60%

# A constant that all field data estimations are multiplied with to
# determine a final estimation.
#indices.fielddata.breaker.overhead: 1.0.3


################################# Threadpools ################################

# Every node holds several thread pools to improve how threads are managed
# within a node. There are several pools, but the important ones include:
# index, search, bulk, refresh
#thread_pool.index.type: fixed

###################################### SQL ####################################

# Defines whether SQL statements resulting in modification operations are
# allowed on this node.
#node.sql.read_only: false

# A SQL DML operation over a huge amount of rows (such as INSERT FROM
# SUBQUERY, UPDATE or COPY FROM) can take an enormous amount of time and
