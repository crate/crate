# CrateDB Helm Chart

Deploy a cluster of CrateDB instances on K8S with this chart.

The `templates` directory contains the definition of the service and the statefulset.

The `values.yml` file contains the default values you can tweak for the `crate.yml` template.

Install this chart from this folder using `helm install .`.
You may want to adjust first your preferred number of nodes in `values.yml`.
