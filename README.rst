==================================
CRATEDB: Put data to work. Simply.
==================================

    CrateDB allows to query and compute data with SQL in real time by providing a
    distributed aggregation engine, native search and super simple scalability.

Features include
----------------

Familiar SQL syntax:

::

    select * from users;
    insert into users (name) values ('Arthur');

Semi-structured data::

    create table demo (
        name string,
        obj object (dynamic) as (
            age int
        ),
        tags array (string)
    );

::

    insert into demo (name, obj, tags) values
        ('Trillian',
         {age = 39, gender='female'}, // Note that gender wasn't defined in the schema!
         ['mathematician', 'astrophysicist']);

::

    select * from demo where obj['gender'] = 'female';

::

    select * from demo where 'mathematician'= any (tags);


High availability, resiliency, and scalability in a distributed design::

    create table t (string name)
    clustered into 5 shards with (number_of_replicas = 1); // this is actually the default!

::

    select count(*) from sys.nodes;
    select table_name, count(*) from sys.shards group by 1;

Powerful Lucene based full-text search::

    select title from wikipedia where match((title 1.5, text 1.0), 'Hitchhiker')
