========
Crate DB
========

Crate is a shared nothing, fully searchable, document oriented
cluster database.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database

Differences to MongoDB, CouchDb
===============================

- Each node is the same, no need to have special types of nodes.

- No MapReduce or specialities needed for grouping or searching data.

- Full blown search engine built-in.

Differences to Mysql, Postgresql
================================

- Shared nothing, horizontal scalable.

- Document based instead of relational.

- No transactions supported.

- Dynamic Schema support, which means it is possible to add fields on
  the fly.

- Denormalized storage required.


BUILD
=====

Building a tarball is done by maven with the command::

    >>> mvn clean package

Resulting tarballs will reside in the folder ``releases``.


Crate settings
==============

Crate settings can be specified in 3 different file formats in the ``config``
directory:

- YAML: crate.yml
- JSON: crate.json
- Java Properties File: crate.properties

There must not exist an elasticsearch config file (yml, json or properties
format).
