About
=====

CrateDB is a distributed SQL database that makes it simple to store and analyze
massive amounts of data in real-time.

CrateDB offers the `benefits`_ of an SQL database *and* the scalability and
flexibility typically associated with NoSQL databases. Modest CrateDB clusters
can ingest tens of thousands of records per second without breaking a
sweat. You can run ad-hoc queries using `standard SQL`_. CrateDB's blazing-fast
distributed query execution engine parallelizes query workloads across the
whole cluster.

CrateDB is well suited to `containerization`_, can be `scaled horizontally`_
using ephemeral virtual machines (e.g., `Kubernetes`_, `AWS`_, and `Azure`_)
with `no shared state`_. You can deploy and run CrateDB on any sort of network
â€” from personal computers to `multi-region hybrid clouds and the edge`_.


Features
========

- Use `standard SQL`_ via the `PostgreSQL wire protocol`_ or an `HTTP API`_.

- Dynamic table schemas and queryable objects provide
  document-oriented features in addition to the relational features of SQL.

- Support for time-series data, real-time full-text search, geospatial data
  types and search capabilities.

- Horizontally scalable, highly available and fault-tolerant clusters that run
  very well in virtualized and containerized environments.

- Extremely fast distributed query execution.

- Auto-partitioning, auto-sharding, and auto-replication.

- Self-healing and auto-rebalancing.

- `User-defined functions`_ (UDFs) can be used to extend the functionality of CrateDB.


Screenshots
===========

CrateDB provides an `Admin UI`_:

Try CrateDB
===========

The fastest way to try CrateDB out is by running:

.. code-block:: console

    sh$ bash -c "$(curl -L try.crate.io)"

Or spin up the official `Docker image`_:

.. code-block:: console

    sh$ docker run --publish 4200:4200 --publish 5432:5432 crate -Cdiscovery.type=single-node

Visit the `installation documentation`_ to see all the available download and
install options.

Once you're up and running, head over to the `introductory docs`_. To interact
with CrateDB, you can use the Admin UI `sql console`_ or the `CrateDB shell`_
CLI tool. Alternatively, review the list of recommended `clients and tools`_
that work with CrateDB.

For container-specific documentation, check out the `CrateDB on Docker how-to
guide`_ or the `CrateDB on Kubernetes how-to guide`_.
