CrateDB is a distributed SQL database that makes it simple to store and analyze massive amounts of machine data in real-time.

Features of CrateDB:

- Standard SQL plus dynamic schemas, queryable objects, geospatial features, time series data, first-class BLOB support, and realtime full-text search.
- Horizontally scalable, highly available, and fault tolerant clusters that run very well in virtualized and containerised environments.
- Extremely fast distributed query execution.
- Auto-partitioning, auto-sharding, and auto-replication.
- Self-healing and auto-rebalancing.

CrateDB offers the scalability and flexibility typically associated with a NoSQL database and is designed to run on inexpensive commodity servers and can be deployed and run across any sort of network. From personal computers to multi-region hybrid clouds.

The smallest CrateDB clusters can easily ingest tens of thousands of records per second. And this data can be queried, ad-hoc, in parallel across the whole cluster in real time.
