========
Crate DB
========

Crate is a shared nothing, fully searchable, document oriented
cluster database.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database

Crate depends on elasticsearch, a real-time search and analytics engine.
For details see
http://www.elasticsearch.org/


Differences to MongoDB, CouchDb
===============================

- Each node is the same, no need to have special types of nodes.

- No MapReduce or specialities needed for grouping or searching data.

- Full blown search engine built-in.


Differences to Mysql, Postgresql
================================

- Shared nothing, horizontal scalable.

- Document based instead of relational.

- No transactions supported.

- Dynamic Schema support, which means it is possible to add fields on
  the fly.

- Denormalized storage required.

Installation
============

Download the latest version of crate, unpack it and start it:

 $ bin/crate


Under *nix system, the command will start the process in the background.
To run it in the foreground, add the -f switch to it:

 $ bin/crate -f


Configuration
=============

The settings file is located at config/crate.yml
The used default options are documented in this file.
To load a settings file located somewhere else in the system
pass the option -Des.config=/path/to/config.yml to the start script.

Any option can be configured either by the config file or as system
property. If using system properties the required prefix 'es.' will
be ignored.

For example, configuring the cluster name by using system properties
will work this way:

 $ crate -Des.cluster.name=cluster

Which is exactly the same like setting the cluster name by the config
file:

 cluster.name = cluster

Settings will get applied in the following order where the latter one
will overwrite the prior one:

 1. internal defaults
 2. system properties
 3. options from config file
