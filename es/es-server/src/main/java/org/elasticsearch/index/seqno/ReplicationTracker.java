 * The global checkpoint is the highest sequence number for which all lower (or equal) sequence number have been processed
 * on all shards that are currently active. Since shards count as "active" when the master starts
 * them, and before this primary shard has been notified of this fact, we also include shards that have completed recovery. These shards
 * have received all old operations via the recovery mechanism and are kept up to date by the various replications actions. The set of

     *   handoff. If the target shard is successfully initialized in primary mode, the source shard of a primary relocation is then moved
