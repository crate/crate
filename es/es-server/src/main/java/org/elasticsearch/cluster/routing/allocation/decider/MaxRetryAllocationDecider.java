 * An allocation decider that prevents shards from being allocated on any node if the shards allocation has been retried N times without
 * success. This means if a shard has been INITIALIZING N times in a row without being moved to STARTED the shard will be ignored until
 * the setting for {@code index.allocation.max_retry} is raised. The default value is {@code 5}.
 * Note: This allocation decider also allows allocation of repeatedly failing shards when the {@code /_cluster/reroute?retry_failed=true}
 * API is manually invoked. This allows single retries without raising the limits.
