/**
 * Method represents the equivalent of a Java method available as a whitelisted class method
 * within Painless. Methods for Painless classes may be accessed exactly as methods for Java classes
 * are using the '.' operator on an existing class variable/field. Painless classes may have multiple
 * methods with the same name as long as they comply with arity overloading described in
 * {@link WhitelistClass}.
 *
 * Classes may also have additional methods that are not part of the Java class the class represents -
 * these are known as augmented methods. An augmented method can be added to a class as a part of any
 * Java class as long as the method is static and the first parameter of the method is the Java class
 * represented by the class. Note that the augmented method's parent Java class does not need to be
 * whitelisted.
